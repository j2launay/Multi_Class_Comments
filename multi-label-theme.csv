3,"* As someone who prefers face-to-face appointments, I thought it was disappointing that only my first appointment was face-to-face. I was told all subsequent appointments had to be either a phone call, or via a video call providing I was happy for my appointment to be recorded and used for training purposes, which I wasn't.

* During my first phone appointment I explained that I really didn't find the online questionnaire useful and would prefer not to do it and was told I had to. I felt Talking Therapies was too structured and regimented and there was very little flexibility. The sessions revolved around questionnaires and worksheets which felt like completing homework.

* After only a couple of appointments my therapist went off sick for a couple of months. Whilst this is totally understandable, I feel I should have been offered another therapist rather than having no-one.

* When my therapist did return, I received a rather rude email saying she was back and had been trying to contact me, and if I didn't repsond I would be removed from Talking Therapies. I checked and I'd only received one phone call earlier that morning from a private number and no message, so I had no way to know who called me and was unable to respond. The message felt rather abrupt and made it sound like I'd been ignoring her, which I hadn't.",[0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

5,"*1. Husband had to wait down for more than 3 hours and was not shared my room details or my whereabouts, even though I needed him to be with me. 

2. Shared and handed over all my prescription medicines to the pharmacist, but throughout my stay my regular medication was not given to me even once. 

3. Nurses were very nice to talk to but that's that. Nurse Michelle was too busy to even get me from the recovery room where i had to wait for her for more than 2 hours, after many reminders from the recovery room nurse, she send someone else to get me; my call remote was kept far; bed alarm didn't work; lost my dignity while trying to go to the toilet after surgery and had an accident; nurses telling me to raise my arms even though i am not supposed to raise my arms for 3 months; no communication between the nurses on duty, every time i had to explain what my surgery details are and what i can do & what not; my husband was quoted approx £200 for his stay or more if he choose to stay with me; I was in tears to get any pain medication; No nurse came for helping with personal hygiene as well.  

4. Doctor on duty, well, i met with Dr George at around 1:30 pm where I was quoted that they forgot about me! I told him he is not the only one!! Throughout my stay that's the only time i met a doctor after surgery.

5. No cleaning of the room or toilets. for the first time in my life i got a UTI and fluid on the site of surgery. I am currently on strong antibiotics. I am a sepsis survivor and have a week immunity and with the lack of any cleaning there, this is ought to happen.

2) No one said anything about the cost of my visit. I raised this with Prof PS, who said that was normal, since I am insured. However, that is not an acceptable answer. First, as I told Prof PS, I have a high excess on the policy, and, second, I may, in any event, choose not to go ahead with treatment. In either case, it would be me who would pay the cost of obtaining advice at the first consultation.

I challenged this (as the referral letter was specific) and then suddenly they changed their mind and sent me the registration email request (which included loads of typos and didn't even make sense). 
3. The next morning I receive an email saying that there is an appointment available that day at 1:30pm so I replied immediately confirming I will attend. Had no response until 1:20pm when I am almost at the clinic saying that appointment had been held for someone else and was no longer available. Incredibly frustrating.

58,"11th April - Admissions was incredibly unorganized for a private hospital. My 77 year old father was kept waiting in the reception for an hour+ with no information given and very basic instructions. I arrived at 6:45 for my appointment and was still not admitted at 07:50. 

The reception staff told us to wait at the chairs but no information was given at all. The single  admissions staff when they turned up were picking people up at random and not in order of arrival. This stressed my father as his surgery was booked in just under an hours time. 

In my view the communication was very poor during the admissions and could see no reason for the lack of coordination and the lateness of admissions. Unfortunately the admission service was disappointing considering it was self-paying procedure. Very disappointing and quite let down. 

Once on the ward on the fifth floor, the nurses were friendly, helpful and caring. They took time to care for my father before his surgery

Some highlights from time in the ward:

11 Apr - Kirie and Claudine were very attentive, friendly and helpful after surgery.
 Claudine took very good care of my father visiting every 10-15 mins and gave her full care and attention to my father. I was very impressed with support I saw. 

12th Apr - According to my father nurse Anita left him twice with a wet bed and only when he insisted something happened, she said she would ask Billy to change but on second occasionally she completely forgot.  Only when Billy came to do observations was this sorted.
One further occasional he had blood on his leg and she asked him to clean it himself. From observation she was keen to delegate work and not action anything herself. Charge Nurse Antonio was caring and had to step in to cover some of the behaviours.

14 Apr - Nurse Paolo was very patient providing care and consideration and helped with pain relief he was always at hand and spent an hour plus trying to clear blood clots using the irrigation. 

Sarah Wills Lee Urologist Nurse gave my father a lot of time and has a very caring nature. She provided exceptional care over the 4 days he was on the ward. I was also pleased with the outcome of the surgery conducted by Mr Nathan and he took time to visit me during my recovery. 

Overall the stay in the hospital was positive apart from the very unorganized admissions process and one day on the ward on 12 Apr.",[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.]

My operation was three days ago and I have still not had a follow-up appointment scheduled with the surgeon (Senthil Nathan) which I was told to expect since he had done the surgery (this is separate from my appointment with Ramesh).

130,"A few points:

1. Time from GP to community mental health was very long - about 6 months, during which time other delaying services (such as MRi scan) could have been scheduled. Care operating in sequential blocks with no information passed from one stage to the next until it had completed is very in-efficient in overall terms and does not allow optimisations to take place. The oft stated response that ""this is how it is done in the NHS"" have become wearing. If IT or construction projects operated in this way we would still be in the third world. It has nothing to do with funding but does have to do with thinking and organisation.

2. MRi scan process. There are two points to bring out here. The first is that the service is very variable across the Berkshire trust. I was faced with a long wait before the scan which I challenged and manage to get earlier than expected date. The delay between scan and results is even worse being about 3 months. My wife had an MRI scan in Reading which was booked on a saturday, took place early the next day (Sunday) with results provided by Sunday lunchtime. This was the same trust. The second point is that when the scan process was started, I was in contact with the MRI unit in Andover, which was free at the time and could have scanned me within an hour. Unfortunately the NHS trust model, which strongly points out that this is not a national health service but a set of independent parallel inefficient organisations, could not make use of this ""national"" resource and would require going back 6 months to the GP stage and starting from scratch. I was therefore trapped into an inefficient system. The MRI scans are merely files that could be transferred from Andover to Thatcham securely, but this is not how the NHS works - in fact it fights against these optimisations.

3. The diagnosis: It would be useful to have a little more information on the F067 outcome since this has several sub-classifications that have a potential statistical risk for future pathways and life expectancy. This increases stress levels because I have little information to direct study of the subject and remdial actions. I point out the obvious that short term memory loss does make it difficult to remember every detail of conversations and so is lost to the process. This is a general problem throughout the service from GP to consultant and not directed at any individual.",[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

For example, documents and scans provided to CCUS from me here in the UK for the 2nd opinion were initially not made available to CCL. In addition, there seems to be little if any link between CCL-based healthcare providers and their US counterparts. Also, I do not believe CCL is adequately ""plugged in"" to what research and advances are being undertaken at CCUS.  I assume my healthcare provider would benefit from such an association.

The hospital is a very clinical environment with little signage which is a bit of a double edge sword as the subtely is welcome from a privacy perspective but from a practical perspective it is hard to know where to go/what to do etc.  It lacks a little 'warmth' in terms of the professional approach being almost business like as opposed to compassionate.  The staff doing the tests were kind and did their roles very quickly and efficiently which was great. We were seen swiftly and the nurses explained where we had to go and when we could leave.  The Nurse who performed the ECG was especially kind in that she showed us the admission rooms upstairs to help Mum see in advance of her op, where she might be and what the room might be like.

353,"After a fall at Christmas, my 93 year old mother was placed under the care of our local Palliative care team at home, mostly Andy Harris and Kaye Riches, both of whom were exceptional with regards to their professionalism, knowledge of medical care, compassion shown to mum and the whole family and kindness and understanding at an extremely difficult time. I cared for my mum at home, but felt 100% supported by the palliative team, district nurses and our carers ProActive Medicare, not once did I feel afraid that there would be no one there to help if I needed them 24/7 and I had to call on their services many times, nothing was ever too much trouble. This team deserves an award for their absolute dedication to their work, their patients and their families. It is with great sadness that I have to say we lost our dear mum earlier this week, but I know in my heart that she was treated with dignity and the utmost care and respect right to the very end, we could have done no more, please please please pass on my thanks to these beautiful humans, they truly are amazing people.",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

Throughout my treatment, Holly has been kind, supportive and encouraging. She’s been extremely clear in what I need to do and how I should think about things in different and more constructive ways. This was backed up with resources and hand outs that she emailed me.

Holly was able to adapt really well to my changing needs and was happy to go off-plan if needed. She’d always ask me which order I’d like to go in these situations.

At no point was anything rushed, or missed. I feel that I’m in a far better place following my sessions with Holly, and I’m extremely grateful to have been referred to someone who is brilliant at their job.

Everyone seemed highly competent and efficient. Technology was excellent (all obs readings input straight into a digital file, drugs protocol kept online so any changes were executed immediately). The good service seemed rooted in good management. For example, all nurses came to say hi when they came on shift. That's nice. Support staff, even cleaners, usually said hi as well.

558,"All staff were superb.  Definitely the hospital's strongest asset.  And I mean all staff, from consultants through to cleaners.  Admin, catering, pharmacy, everyone.  Well trained, pateinet-friendly and a credit to the organisation.  I was comfortable and well cared for.  But 2 criticisms:
1.  My room looked beautiful, but was dysfunctional!  I was on the top floor in a corner room with a magnificent view out of 2 of the 3 windows, but face to face with an office full of people (in the building aross the road) in the other.  The only means of privacy was to close the blind in that window.  But all the blinds work together, so either I had to close all blinds on all windows and be without natural light or any outlook, or remain on display to the office workers.  Why on earth couldn't that window be frosted, like the bathroom window next to it?  Or have a blind that works independently.  None of the blinds could be partly closed - it was all or nothing.
The clock in the room is not visible from the bed or the patient's easy-chair.  The chair and its electric lead are something of an encumbrance or a trip-hazzard, getting in and out of the bathroom.  There are no hooks in the bathroom to hang your clothes/dressing gown.  Nowhere in the room to hang anything longer than a shirt, the securinty safe is at knee level and no drawer or shelf for belongings at a convenient level.
2.  Lack of communication between the consultant's team and the nursing team caused long delays.  I was informed that that the consultant who had performed my operation would visit me the next morning, to check me and advise if I could start taking liquids of food again.  I (and the nusinig staff) waited all day and until midday the following day until anyone from that team came.  That meant I remained without  food or drink for longer than was necesary.  I was only booked in for one night and had expected to be discharged the day following my operation.  I was not advised of the need to stay another night until quite late that day.  There does appear to be poor communication between doctors and nursing staff.  And the patient!",[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0.]

Didn't ask how I was if I needed any help getting up from the machine, if I needed any assistance ect. They didn't seem bothered, they didn't care about me. Everything was very abrupt very unfriendly just took the equipment off and rushed out from the room without saying anything of asking if I needed any assistance or had any questions or what to expect next. All they told me was how to leave the building. Think they were just interested in getting rid of me. Was really unprofessional, and was the worst MRI experience I have had at any hospital.

Medical Secretary brilliant had all my records transferred from NHS super quickly so I didn't have the stress  dealing  with it myself, something I am very grateful for at moment.  Reception and clinic staff all fantastic too. I saw Professor Murphy . He was absolutely amazing and a super nice Gentleman too and really listened to our concerns and made us feel more positive tha anyone else we have seen yet..  appointment  was to get a second  opinion and he didn't rush us, made sure we asked all questions,  gave honest sound  opinions , and made us feel on right track. I can honestly say I felt a lot lighter leaving the clinic than I have in several months. We also scheduled a further follow up a week later via telephone as was recommended.  Consultant understood we had to travel a long way to go to appointment and was a nice touch he mentioned telephone discussion next. I also felt for first time I have talked with various doctors, he knew exactly what nature of problem was even as extremely rare presentation and made me feel less isolated and scared.  Had a very calm , confident, reassuring manner,but you felt you were definitely talking with someone who is top of the game and the relief that gave us was priceless. His honest  clear opinions were good to hear and anyone with complicated colorectal issue ,I would recommend Professor Murphy completely.  A thoroughly nice man and fantastic surgeon with a kindness and human touch that cannot be learnt. Top marks! Do not hesitate to book an appointment if its what's needed. The whole clinic is top notch, very caring , calm environment with thoroughly nice people there. Thank you.",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

I had been trying to progress my GPs OOA community referral since 27/3 and by this time I was broken and afraid and desperate. My friend drove me to the Basildon, as a last resort, to expedite the referral. My thinking was very disturbed and my thoughts were frightening me a great deal. The team all tried hard to help me. But by the end of the day, the red tape got the better of all of us (on 15/3) and the nurses couldn’t progress my referral any further. But they made a plan for me that I could call them across Sunday if I needed to and they agreed I should return on Monday (17th) to meet Dr Menesh and hopefully make some more concrete decisions about my treatment. They encouraged me to call them as I couldn’t access the crisis team from surrey (as 111, option 2, doesn’t reach Basildon from surrey). The offer, to call UCT was genius and kept me feeling safe until Monday. I’d been waiting 3 wks since my referral was sent and my MH had been deteriorating by the day - I could feel that happening.

Little things like basic knowledge of how to take blood pressure eg  One should never ask a patient questions whilst taking blood pressure as this increases blood pressure upon which wrong diagnosis can be given. Cuff shouldn’t be placed around the elbow etc. 

There appears to be no seamless, handover of patient information and questions answered. I’ve been asked four times the very same questions from four different nurses from both floors, once should be enough, recorded and handed over to nurses downstream. 

Bathroom 
Curious to know why toilet seats are not soft close to avoid noise. 

Bathroom lights only turn off after one hour therefore fully lit throughout the night as nurses coming in and out disturbing the bathroom sensor. One would expect the bathroom light to go off after 30 seconds of none use. 

The bed constantly inflates, deflates, makes a whirring noise, impossible to sleep. The bed was eventually switched off after I asked three separate nurses after which the bed continually beeped for approximately 30 minutes, all in all a bad night sleep. 

Would have been helpful. If there was a arm above the bed, so one could pull themselves up to go to the bathroom and back especially after hernia operations.

A separate small point. Again re mental health, if someone has a mental health issue, it is important to let them rest and not ask them for hard tasks. For example, closer integration of all staff on the ward to ensure that a patient is not constantly being disturbed (for food, therapy, doctor visit, cleaning etc) would be helpful.

There should without exception be a 24/7 on-call liaison psychiatry service for any facility that cares for inpatients (ward doctors specialising in general medical specialties are not adequate for this purpose). It could be considered highly unsafe to operate without this in place.  There should be a 24/7 point of contact on every ward for external care professionals to be in touch with urgent recommendations for the treatment of co-morbid conditions of current inpatients.

1063,"At one point a child ran into the test room whilst the lady was explaining to us and our daughter the process of the test. Which we are very understanding that there are other children with additional needs that can't be stopped going into a room. These things happen. 

We feel however other staff members accompanying this child, could be more aware of these issues arising and to avoid this potentially disturbing the test, the QB testing take part in a secluded part of the building where appropriate. Just to avoid potential distractions during the testing. 

Also, we have come away with no official diagnosis from a QB test, which is also understandable and I respect and advocate for an indepth assessment. 

Is there anyway a ""working diagnosis"" could be implemented if the QB testing comes back positive?

This is merely to be able to evidence further support the child in-between QB testing and formal diagnosis for schools & GPs to acknowledge and implement changes to best support them in their educational settings. 

Also I understand there is an approx 4 months waiting time between testing and clinical diagnosis, this is a fairly short time in real terms. 
In regards to a child struggling with the negative effects of a neurodevelopmental condition, this is an extremely long time, to endure symptoms that they have already experience for most of their life already. 

Is there any way to get a streamlined pathway set up for these children who present with a positive QB test?

After being returned to my room post op, i had to request to be given some food as i had not eaten in 24 hours. Two members of the catering team arrived to take my order and my partner and i both commented on how terrible one of the staffs bedside manner was. She was very blunt and abrupt and as i was still under the influence of general i found her manner to be unusual. After an hour she returned to my room to ask how my meal was, but my meal had not arrived. I ordered a simple soup and apple juice.  Another 30mins went by and still no meal and no explanation. Without the help of my partner and the charge nurse, i have little faith that my meal would have ever arrived. My toilet broke so my room was moved and at 17:30 the same woman returned to my door to take my order as the physio was leaving. The physio invited her in, and she said, ""Oh no, I'll come back she needs something special."" No one returned for an hour and i was left feeling like i had done something wrong. Again, i had to put in multiple requests with the charge nurse to chase. At this point, head of catering craig came to my room to personally take my dinner order. I complained about the attitude and service and he assured me it wouldn't happen again. Another 2 hours passed and still no food. At 8pm the same lady returned to take my order and told me that ordering hours close at 7:30. My evening meal arrived at 9pm. This was extremely distressing, i felt disrepected, made to feel anxious about the care i could expect from the hospital and exhausted by the effort it took to get a meal.

On the last day, i waited for 6 hours to receive my medication from the pharmacy. The neurologist nurse Anders and doctor George both advised i should be staying another night, when i aksed about my insurance they retracted that decision as they did not want to make the phone call for me. This decision was made at 2pm, i was then left to wait until 6 pm for the pharmacy to bring me my medication and an additional 2 hours to be discharged.

Basically I was not informed that I may be injected, before the MRI scan.
As a deaf person, please be deaf aware. (This is not the first time I've experience). Unfortunately. To keeps on reminding the nurses to remove their facemask, so I can lip-read. 
& lastly, one of the nice lady nurse (Maria) I think her name is, basically was quite fast when asking me the questionnaires on the fill-out form.
That it.
Overall, very satisfied with the care I've received. Thank you. Appreciate it.

I have a complex medical history and knew I was not ready to go home after only one night: very high pain levels in post-op recovery, the need for a PCA, an allergic reaction to one or more of the meds and a general feeling of being too unwell to go home resulted in a notable amount of time and stress securing an extended stay.

It was no-one’s fault; everyone was as helpful as possible. I made clear that I was happy to pay whatever additional cost necessary. Ultimately, the allergic reaction provided a reason for the Clinic to approach BUPA and the second night’s stay was approved. 

It seemed that BUPA’s coverage determined the length of care rather than the doctors and nurses assessing individual circumstances. I wonder if there is a better and more timely way to resolve similar situations going forward.

Also, I was given discharge instructions for the many meds but nothing relating to post-op expectations (adhesiolysis, appendectomy), wound care, what to expect re pain levels, limiting movement, returning to exercise, etc. I am still in a lot of pain and don’t know if that’s normal.

She is empathetic, polite, listens to what I have to say, makes it easy to talk to her and appears to genuinely want to help people. It is quite obvious that Carley has a passion and love for her job, a job that I'm sure can be quite thankless at times and also emotionally draining. Not that you would know from talking with her. 

I honestly can't compliment Carley enough and thank her for her help so far and ongoing. I don't find the particular subjects I need to discuss with Carley an easy thing to talk about but I feel very much at ease doing so and that is due to Carley's professionalism but also compassion and how well she does her job.

Thank You Carley. Your Team and profession should be proud to have you!

I appreciate that I was given an appointment so soon after it was requested.  I was not seen on time, I was told to be there by 11.10 for an 11.30 appointment but was seen quite a bit later.  I did not even mind the wait, although I was not informed how much longer it would be or what the holdup was.  The radiographer/nurse were polite but did not provide me with helpful information as to what I would experience.  I was given IV Buscopan.  Very shortly after I felt that my mouth was so dry that my throat closed and I could not swallow.  I stopped the process as not being able to swallow made me panic.  I asked for water.  I was given a couple of sips on the side of my mouth without moving and it was not sufficient and it spilt.  I was not given a straw or enabled to sip properly.  The most important thing I can say, and that I only became aware of after researching it after the procedure, is that Buscopan can cause a dry mouth.    If only the radiographer/nurse had mentioned this to me beforehand it would not have been so alarming when I couldn't swallow.  If they would have let me just sip some water properly it would have made the world of difference.  I have had an anaphylactic reaction to Asprin in the past and so this side affect was very unpleasant and I was concerned I was having an allergy.  The two inadequate sips made a difference.  A clear explanation is what I needed and a bit of water that I could sip properly.  When I changed and then left I was not told that I might have some side effects from the IV dye and what to expect.  I had nausea and quite a bad headache for many hours after.  Eventually I looked it up last night and I saw this is a common side effect.  Again, if I would have been told this, and to drink a good amount of water afterwards, I would not have been alarmed that something was not right.    With the ear plugs in and the headphones on top I could not hear the instructions properly either and so had an anxious time trying to make out what the voice was telling me to do.  It would have been very helpful if I would have been told beforehand that I would be told how to breathe etc and hold my breath. It was after a few 'hit and miss' that I think I finally worked it out.   I read all the notes sent to me on pdf beforehand.  Not one mentioned the side effects I could experience after and nobody told me about it on the day.   I am going to be having surgery soon and I am quite anxious about it after my experience yesterday.",[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

2071,"David Brennan, my trauma therapist, has been an essential pillar of support in my journey towards healing and recovery. His expertise, empathy, and dedication have played a significant role in helping me navigate the challenges of my PTSD. I'd like to share some words about how he has positively impacted my life.

First and foremost, David Brennan has helped me regain a sense of confidence and self-assurance that I thought was forever lost. Trauma and PTSD had really affected my one's self-esteem and I felt quite powerless but through his guidance, I began to rebuild my self-worth. David created a safe and non-judgmental space where I could express my feelings and confront the past. His unwavering support made me feel validated and heard, which, in turn, boosted my confidence.

One of the most valuable aspects of his therapy was the array of tools he equipped me with to cope with my PTSD. Exposure therapy, in particular, was a turning point in my recovery. By gradually facing the situations and triggers that had previously paralyzed me with fear, I learned to manage my reactions and reduce the intensity of my symptoms. David's compassionate guidance during these exposures was instrumental in making them effective and empowering.

Additionally, David introduced me to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which transformed the way I think and respond to traumatic memories and triggers. Through CBT, I acquired the skills to identify and challenge negative thought patterns that perpetuated my suffering. David taught me how to reframe my perspective, fostering a healthier and more positive mindset. This change in my thought patterns has been a cornerstone in my healing process.

In essence, David Brennan's compassionate and professional support has made an indelible impact on my life. His guidance, alongside the effective therapeutic techniques he employs, has allowed me to regain more control over my life, diminish the grip of trauma, and move towards a brighter, healthier future. I am deeply grateful for his expertise and unwavering commitment to my well-being, as he has been instrumental in helping me with my challenges of PTSD.",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1.]

Poor English too.
Impossible to hear him & he complained he couldn't hear me - this  is not acceptable as during Covid restrictions / dividers YOU should have found a better way to resolve this..

The desk on the upstairs floor was an improvement but three chattering women behind the screens did not give good impression.
I realise that whilst it may be problematic to find staff, the training of staff by management is not impressive.
I was kept waiting for 25-30 minutes and then asked at the desk whether my consultant was running late. The reply was yes BUT none had communicated this to me, so I was less than impressed.

The Cleveland Clinic has an excellent reputation but this was not evident from my visit.

I selected my consultant myself  because of his excellent reputation and was in no way influenced by the Cleveland Clinic - your questionnaire does not address this.
Your questions about his care are therefore not relevant in this context.


Overall a disappointing introduction to the Cleveland Clinic.

Furthermore previous phone calls from (I believe) a call centre on behalf of the clinic were extremely irritating & out of order. Unclear messages were left on the answer machine, with no mention of the Cleveland Clinic - just a first name was left.

2138,"Different people from the service have said that BEDS sees an array of patients, from a range of backgrounds, but it didn’t seem like that has informed how treatment is approached. I understand the importance of a structured approach , but I definitely found the dietetics and FS less helpful because of the unique and difficult nature of my situation. I also recognise that it’s impossible to tailor treatment to every individual, but I think there’s no point recognising that people come from different ethnic backgrounds and socio-economic backgrounds if it doesn’t inform any aspect of the process. Coming from a single parent, working-class, asian household where mental health is a taboo subject, it is simply not possible for me to approach recovery in the same way as somebody from a white, middle-class household, so using the same ‘script’ with me as you would with them will not work, not because I don’t want to recover, but because logistically there are some things I can’t do. It also felt like there was a lack of empathy in regards to this; it isn’t particularly helpful to keep being told “you’ve turned 18, you’re an adult now, this is all your responsibility” when you’re already having to deal with recovery on your own, aside from support from your school. It isn’t particularly motivating and I think it’s overly harsh when people come to the service wanting to get better and are aware that it’s on them to do so. 

I also think there needs to be way more transparency about where you are on the waiting lists. There was no indication that FS would take 6 months to happen, and only after I’d raised how long I’d be waiting. I absolutely understand that the NHS is underfunded and these things take a while, but I think empathy and recognition of the fact that waiting is really hard is something that is really important. I can tell how committed everyone at the service is, and nothing is anybody’s ‘fault’ but with the number of BAME people with EDs rising, it’s important that cultural factors and also socio-economic factors have greater weighing and inform how you are approached more.",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

The problem was that he was not polite to me and he spoke to me as if I had to do it for him. The reason I was waiting by the way is because he called the wrong number for the ultrasound so he didn't go through and hence I was waiting despite of me being there earlier. I heard him calling for someone else that had an MRI to make sure he was taken in ( even though he was already taken in by one of the nurses and probably he missed it) but he didn't do the same for me.  My appointment for the ultrasound was rushed and the result was not explained to me clearly.

3577,"Firstly, Mr Russo has been absolutely superb throughout the process. He has been nothing but five stars throughout this process. 

However, the care given by your nurses/ HCAs was sometimes reflective of that out of a nightmare. In ICU I woke up to two nurses struggling with something caught around the back of my bed. One of them reached around and moved the controls blindly, causing an air cushion to ram into my lower back, and me having to try and get off of it whilst screaming out in pain. Then I had an issue with my bladder, so the nurse blindly pressed her fingers into my incision/ wound on my front causing me severe pain. She told me ""Oh, I thought they only went through your back"". 

When in room 425, the issues were endless, and I was actually left in tears on the phone to my wife, contemplating leaving and going home because I was not being cared for properly. I had my drain bottle kicked a number of times, causing it to yank at the insertion point of my back. Despite me explaining clearly to a number of HCAs how I needed to get back into bed, as stipulated to me by the physio, I had my legs flung seperately onto the bed, again causing me great pain. 

I had issues with my bowel movements post surgery. I was given medication to help with this and finally got to go. My excrement was left festering in a commode for 7.5 hours before finally being cleared up. My wife was present to witness this. This happened again and it was left there for 5 hours, and was ignored by cleaning staff. The nurses/ HCAs were aware I had taken medication and was attempting to empty my bowels. This is inexcusable. 

I was not being listened to by many of your staff with the issues I was having. It was far too easy to close the door on me and leave me for hours. I even had a HCA ask me how to turn off my buzzer- I was unsure and tried to help her. I woke up in the morning and tried to open my blinds- they would open. I try to press the buzzer but nothing happened. It was later established the buzzer had been unplugged from the wall. 

All of these issues were brought up by myself multiple times when I was with you. I was told the ward manager would be talking to me. I have never heard from anyone. 

Mr Russo and my surgery experience aside, the nursing and after care on the fourth floor was an utter disgrace. My family and friends are completely shocked that such a high level hospital is allowing this to happen. 

I have tried calling the fourth floor ward on the number I was given for a few issues I've had since leaving your hospital. I would estimate I have made 20+ calls, and the phone has been answered once.",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.]

3751,"From both our prospectus. The appointment was beneficial and I believe that when training days are held, the Trust should consider deaf awareness training, as there are very few medical staff, whatever their position/status/grade level that fully understand what issues deaf people have. It seems to me that training days do not focus on assistance issues, so you are in essence letting all deaf/hearing impaired patients down for just a few simple changes that would benefit a lot if patients. There are so many younger patients who nowadays are also struggling and would benefit from the staff doing deaf awareness courses. . 

Therefore, there was nothing else the lady could have done because they are well tuned into their patients needs, difficulties and issues they have depending upon the level of hearing loss but also the types of issues or difficulty the patient has with the tinnitus sounds and levels of sounds plus vary degrees of sounds as well as when the patient has different sounds in different ears, like music in one ear and say crashing waves in the other at the same time whilst they are trying to distinguish what the speaker is sying. It is very stressful for the patients and the visit to audiology helped me to understand more about how to cope with these ordeals  

The audiologists had the necessary knowledge, skills and understanding to do the appointment to the extent that I had no issues. 

You ask about anything you could have done better. The audiology department is well above the other departments as they fully understand the patients needs in all areas.

However, the Trust is lacking in its knowledge and understanding of the needs of the patients which then let's the audiology department down. 

One area that does need to be looked Into is the mask wearing...why, considering that the department is to do with hearing and the majority of us do lipread to a certain extent, why I ask, are staff wearing completely covered masks so we cannot see the lips? Why has the trust not supplied the staff with the masks that have the lips with clear plastic surrounding the lips area, so we can see the lips or even the full face masks in plastic which would allow the deaf/hearing impaired person to participate in the conversation rather than struggling to understand what is being said because if the covered lips. 

It seems that although audiology do a fantastic job, their work is affected because we struggle due to the Trust not providing Essential equipment to facilitate lip reading for those who are hearing impaired. 

It is the only area that I feel is affecting the department (indeed ALL departments across the Trust) and needs to be reassessed so that all staff are provided with the see through area of the masks and/or plastic face masks that allow lip reading to be accessable for all who require the service/feature/facility etc. 

Another area is that it would be good if the wards were able to request an audiologist to attend the wards to look at patients hearing aids and do repairs if necessary. I struggled from 7th March when admitted until 27th March, the day of my appointment. 

I saw other patients struggling as well. You could use one of the days that audiology department attend the ENT clinics at Wexham Park hospital. Why can they not receive a list of patients currently in their ward who wear hearing aids, so they can then ring the ward to firstly see if the patient is still in the ward. Secondly, to see if the patient had any issues that need addressing like replacement batteries, retubing etc. Thus allowing the patient to hear what is being said rather than trying to second guess what is being said. 

Being deaf is not easy, it's extremely difficult to understand what people are saying, if they are too far away, mumbling, moving around, changing to different levels or tones of speaking from what you understand but suddenly dropping to a lower tone and level that you lose it and struggle to hear what's being said. 

This issue should be given priority in terms of importance, many patients go through their time in the hospital having not fully understood what's been said but worse, much worse. Staff end up believing that they have to raise their voices to get the patient to understand, the patient's lose their dignity and privacy as everyone hears what the doctors/staff are saying. This can be extremely embarrassing, not only for the patient but also others who have no choice but to hear. I'm fortunate that I can switch the hearing aids off, so am saved having these issues, however, others are less fortunate. 

Another area you can utilise is using line a whiteboard or similar item with familiar sentences or phrases on that your staff use on a daily basis, so that instead of shouting etc, the staff can show the card with the question/sentences/phrases or just single words, it would certainly give the hearing impaired a chance to understand what the staff want to share or ask. 

The radiology department would benefit from this. I cannot understand what the machine says or see any diagrams. So it gets to the stage I hear something, no idea what is being said but believe that it is asking me to hold  my breath where I hear sounds that must be where I have to breath in. With chest x-rays I can tell the person to wave at me when they want me to hold my breath. With the other machines, I cannot see the pictures that I see as I'm being moved into the machine, as they disappear and I cannot understand the sounds they are saying, I know they are saying something as can hear the sounds....I just cannot pick up speech 

Life is very difficult as a deaf or hearing impaired person. Try wearing cotton wool stuffed in your ears compacted so you are struggling to hear, then try having a conversation...you will certainly see how difficult it is and would well appreciate the suggestions I am asking for consideration to be implemented, so we become part of your world rather than feeling we don't belong.  

The ward visits would be the most important for those you have who are longer than an average stay. A picture board with staff pictures, names, status plus 'what I can do for you' type of area (like the uniform has changed so much, it is difficult to know what their roles are, whose the one to ask about medication, who to ask about drinks, who to ask for assistance with toilet needs  foid/drink/getting back to bed...would be good I'd we knew these things, I'd we could look at our booklet and know who are HCA's, registered nurses, drugs nurses or even catering staff. 

.I am dyslexic and dyspraxic as well as hearing impaired. I struggle with who is who and this would not only help me because my medication but also I have conditions that also have a detrimental effect on my memory so something like this will help because with all of these issues, they have a huge toll on my listening ability,the more I struggle to hear, the more tired I get. The more tired I get, the mire loss of concentration I go through. It is a vicious circle. It is one that not only affects me, but so many other patients as well. 

If you think about dementia patients. Do you not recognise that the benefit they would gain from these boards/cards would greatly increase their understanding of who is looking after them. One patient had a card in an envelope, she would 5aje the card out, read it (or that is what it looked like to be), then ask the staff a question. As they replied 'Wexham Park hospital' I can only assume that it was where she was but I had no idea of the rest she asked. Having like I guess a memory board type would be good. Another patient, she would walk around the ward, I thing she had 24/7 cate as someone was always with her and they would accompany her on her walks. I often thought, why do they not have a picture there, ask her what it means to her or something like that, something to generate her thinking skills and to try to bring or keep memories alive. There was a piece of paper with the rate on but this was 2 weeks before so was not giving her anything to work with. It was eventually utilised as someone out the correct date and added sunny...butvacluctire eoukdvdo a lot more to stretch her brain. We must utiles the resources we need to make things better for them. It's not always about hearing loss. Hearing loss is only one part of the equation . 

You have to help the patient as best you can. All of the above is a means to assist the patient, make them more accessible to all areas of their  lives, lives that are dependent on being able to understand what they are being asked to do it to reply to questions 
the more integration you Habe between the various hospital departments, the better the service. Hearing loss is very personal to everyone who goes through it. By having ward  visits from audiology automatically, like you do physio, you can ensure the health and wellbeing of all who needs it.   

I hope you can understand that and take this matter seriously. The audiology department do a wonderful job, they are dedicated to ensuring that the patient is able to look after the areas required by giving them strategies and ensuring the hearing aids are working effectively.

Anders was amazing and spoke to us in such a way that put myself and my family at ease. The food service and  cleaning…. Just fantastic, everyone had time to actually say hello with a smile on their face. The nurses… what can I say…. Just wow! Friendly, comforting, helpful, spoke to me like I was a human being not just a body they had to work on! The physio team… brilliant! Yet again they had time to get to you know you a DC remee e me red my name a few days after Jo the corridor when I passed them! The anesthetist listened and reassured. 

I walked to theatre and was amazed at how relaxed every member of staff was in there, I cannot tell you what they meant to me! A huge clinical room, lots of staff, lots of machines, but everyone was organised, relaxed and outstanding! I have always been a very anxious person when it comes to hospitals, this time was harder, fearing results, and leaving our son for the first time ever in his 5 years, but I have to say if I had to return for another procedure I would not be anxious….. I cannot rate everyone on the whole team enough. What a credit  you all are to the hospital! 

Dr Ulbricht told us at our consultation that he was proud of his team….. and I can see why! 

Dr Ulbricht himself, what an amazing relaxed knowledgable man! I have every confidence that if I can ‘be fixed’ he will put every effort in and more.

The Admissions Team did not work well with me.  I have explained the problems to them and Professor Hakim in emails which should be available to you.

Nurse Shola who was principally responsible for my pre-op assessment on 2 August was unable to communicate clearly with me in English at times, because her accent was unclear.  I had to ask her to repeat her questions and comments frequently.  One example was the mispronunciation of ""hernia"" as ""hynia"".  When I the asked her to spell the word, she simply repeated ""hynia"" until I insisted on her spelling it, which she then did correctly.  As an initial contact with nursing staff this did not inspire confidence.

3988,"Good afternoon

This is a formal complaint about the treatment I received at around 3.40pm this afternoon, Friday 23rd September 2022. 

I was treated in an unfriendly, unhelpful and ultimately offensive way when I arrived at the 33 Grosvenor Place reception. 

I gave my name to the receptionist on the left at the desk (Andrew or Andre I believe was his name) and said I was there to see Dr Byrne.  He spent over a minute checking his PC and said he could not find me. 

I repeated my name, which the receptionist on the right correctly repeated back to me. I also repeated that I was there to see Dr Byrne. 

We then spent several minutes with the man on the left asking me to spell “Burn” or “Burns” despite me making it clear the name was Byrne - I spelled it many times. 

After several minutes, the man on the right told me to take a seat. I suggested they should contact Liz Dean and offered to show them my appointment papers. They refused and I sat down, waiting again for some time. 

Eventually, the man on the right said he had checked and there was a Dr Byrne and he would show me up. As we passed the man on the left (Andrew or Andre) he said “We thought your name was Burns. You should have given me your name.”

I reminded him that I had given my name to him. He repeated several times that I had not.

I said I had given him my correct name and it was clear he did not know what he was doing. I also pointed out that I had come to the hospital with a heart condition and his behaviour was offensive. The result of his behaviour was to cause me to have very elevated blood pressure which could well result in medical problems. 

Once I had been shown to reception on the first floor, all other staff I met were superb. I am particularly grateful to Dr Byrne’s PA, Liz Dean, who made a special trip to make sure I was alright. She had been alerted to my problem because I had emailed her to let her know I was at being detained at reception because they did not appear to know who Dr Byrne was.

Yours
Peter Neville

The care given by prof Cobb and dr lossof and their secretaries and associated staff has been excellent as was radiology.
These  ratings only apply to my pre admission screening.
The nurse practitioner who did my initial,assessment and ecg was very good.
When she took me to the phlebotomist she took my three mrsa swans which had not been taken and asked the phlebotomist todo,them.
When she had taken my bloods she said I could go, I told her I had not had my mrsa swans.
She told me I had.
I said I am a dr amd no one has put a swab in my nose and throat and groin.
She told me they had,checked the computer and said they had been taken.
I showed her the three swans brought in and she said they weren’t for me.
I asked her to ask the nurse practitioner which she did who confirmed she had asked her to do them.
She then gave me the swans left the room and said please do them which i had not been a health care ,professional I would have taken her word for it amd returned to brighton without swans being done, with my operation on Tuesday and resident in brighton that could have been disastrous.
I am not complaining she was very nice and courteous and don’t want her to get into trouble , but thought the feedback would me useful

Dr Youngstein decided she needed to do some tests that would take time, but were necessary to get a correct diagnosis. After 8 years of searching, she did manage to find the root cause of my health issues.  She definitely goes above and beyond and really cares about her patients.  Please pass on my sincere thanks to her. 

Dr Youngstein is a real asset to the Cleveland Team.

4708,"I came to Cleveland clinic last June and had such a negative experience I decided I would never use your hospital again but I have gone back on my word as I wanted to see this new consultant. I have a very strong feeling that your staff have not received adequate training and my recent experience just increased this feeling rather than decreased it.
One of the most at risk issues you have is you ironically have this poster up in the cafe about correct labelling on food due to allergies ...except you don't correctly label food. I had fasted for 5hrs and went to the cafe with the assumption I would get food suitable for a coeliac but apparently not. 
But what my visit did highlight is:
-  the food labelling on the sign in front of the food does not match the labelling on the packet of food and this also differs from the chef's opinion. Take for example the greek salad - the sign labelling says it has gluten, the packet says it does not have gluten...the chef thinks it might have gluten in the packet of dressing.
- your staff have not been trained properly in allergies - when I asked for gluten-free bread the cashier offered me vegan bread and I had to correct her and explain vegan does not mean gluten-free and her manager also said this to her.
- initially I was told you did not have food without gluten but after about 20mins and me going back a second time they managed to find gluten free bread out the back.

4710,"I came to the Cleveland as that is where my consultant had the first slot available for my surgery . Whilst the rooms were very spacious and modern, unfortunately my entire stay was marred by a complete lack of organisation or priority of patient care. I don’t know if it was just floor 4 that was chronically understaffed or just very poorly managed but these were a few examples of my issues:

I had to wait in theatre post surgery as there wasn’t a nurse available to receive me
I had been fasting for 15 hours, ordered a sandwich and a tea and waited for 50 minutes
I ordered breakfast for 8am and received it at 940am
I had some physio and was experiencing pain and spoke to a nurse at 1055am to request some pain relief and didn’t receive it until 1202pm in spite of 3 requests to the nurses and my husband asking twice,  y which time the pain was becoming unbearable as I had to wait so long.
I was not kept informed of what needed to happen to facilitate my discharge, and had different nurses telling me different things. 
I didn’t discharge until 2pm due to all of the waiting around and the lack of organisation even though the physio and an earlier doctor had authorised my discharge at 1030am
I waited 40 minutes for a wheelchair to discharge 

The medical team were (mostly) all professional and competent but the administration frankly resembled the NHS which is why I chose to spend a considerable amount of money to go private hoping to avoid unnecessary delays and chaotic organisation. I spoke to the nurse in charge of the floor and he apologised but this is my first impression of the Cleveland and unfortunately I have to say I wouldn’t rush back nor recommend to family and friends. Whilst the procedure and everything around the surgery went smoothly everything else was fairly shambolic to be honest.  have had a couple of procedures at a much smaller hospital Gatwick Park Spire , and whilst the rooms and food were inferior to the Cleveland, I got medication promptly when required and was communicated to regularly and clearly throughout my stay with prompt attention and a prompt efficient discharge.",[0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

I have been with private healthcare since 2003 and all my family are using private health care services in London so I do know what I am talking about. Therefore I did not feel good with the service from the person who took my blood yesterday.
I have warned her I have extremely difficult veins since I was born and it got worse after chemo too. But she wasn't patient enough to look for my veins on the arms when I particularly told her can you try and look at other places first rather than veins on my hand. I do not like it on my hand because it is painful and it would give bruises but she looked at my arms for few seconds and went straight to the hand when I told her not to yet. I know it can be the last resort because it is clearly there but I understand if she had tried a little bit longer, be understanding and listen to me to look at the veins on my arms a bit more careful she might be able to find it and I would feel that she respects what I am telling her and listening to my wishes. 
I have so many people took it from my arms before just need to give it a bit more time especially I need to be a bit more calm.
Even at NHS blood test service, they do not have much time they are still listening to me and calming me down a little so they can find my veins easier. I did not expect this level of service at one of the top private hospital in London. All other private hospitals they all tried to talk and calm me down a little just for me to settle in a bit sometimes that how they can find the veins. One of the blood technician told me to point out where my vein is when I need blood in the future because it is not at normal place and I have pointed to her but she didn't even try to look at it she just said its not there.

5113,"I first attended Cleveland Clinic due to sudden recent swelling of my left foot. My left knee was also slightly distended but the foot much more so.   I have known connective tissue disorders, a combined variant of Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, with very late diagnosis of both, despite major surgery at age five which disclosed half my liver in my right chest. This and my subsequent height and long limbs gave a large clue to weak connective tissue but were ignored.   By age 19 my entire GI tract had stretched and prolapsed onto my low spine. The label of IBS then blocked my care catastrophically, with very late diagnosis and failed gut surgeries forcing me abroad for repair of multiple internal defects of small and large intestines and hernias.   My GP is highly supportive, so are individual specialists. Others are obstructive, even since my rare connective tissue defects were diagnosed. This has proved highly damaging in progressing my care even as my health visibly deteriorates and I suffer daily severe gut blockage and pain.   I chose to see Prof Richard Gibbs at the Cleveland Clinic due to the swelling of my left foot, as we had met previously under the NHS but the waiting times are now too long.  I had found him to be interested in my case and helpful with my care in the recent past, and he remained so this year at the Cleveland. He confirmed the swelling of my left foot, and felt a pulse behind my left knee which indicated an ultrasound of the left leg was advisable. This was carried out and showed a Baker’s cyst and slightly enlarged popliteal vein. He referred me to a knee surgeon Mr Dinesh Nathwani for an opinion on my valgus left TKR with over lengthening of left femur since my left THR contributing to damage at every level of my lumbar spine; he also referred me a gut specialist due to his recognition that my gut issues are worsening, with gut distension and obstruction mainly at the left side which might be involved in the recent left leg / foot swelling.   I found my experience with the gut specialist extremely challenging, in particular his criticism of the colorectal surgeon who operated on me abroad to repair multiple defects, both intrinsic and caused by prior NHS gut surgery which was carried out before my widespread connective tissue disorders were known. It is not unusual that my medical care abroad is challenged or derided by NHS specialists - this has happened on every occasion with reports from even world renowned medical centres in Paris and USA dismissed. But I found it shocking that a private consultant here in London has the same negative strategy.   My meeting with Mr Dinesh Nathwani began well. I found him pleasant and easy to discuss my case with. He ordered X-rays of my hips and left knee. His judgement that the TKR is functioning well and should be left alone is to me acceptable, but other aspects of the consultation were disappointing. In particular, he declined examining my left foot and my suggestion that I remove my left shoe and sock; yet the foot swelling is the significant issue, I can no longer wear any of my shoes and boots and am wearing a soft shoe in a larger size. As before, he was pleasant, but I also found his dismissal of a possible vascular compression link with my left sided gut distension strange, as he had previously acknowledged this possibility. The consultation was extremely brief, giving no time to discuss this more fully.   Mr Nathwani’s report is also disappointing, in particular his statement that there are no vascular or neurological issues with my left leg. My left foot is significantly swollen, which is how and why this circuit of private care originated. Also I have explained that when the gut is especially severely obstructed at the left, where there is known severe small intestine segment distension which is worsening, this causes numbness along my outer left calf. There are clearly vascular and neurological issues. Also my gut issues are not a recent flare-up but an adult lifetime of pain and symptoms which were misdiagnosed for decades and are steadily getting worse.   I appreciate that my case is far too complex to cover in one or two consultations, but the focus at Cleveland Clinic was straightforward - a swollen left foot, involving left knee with possible involvement of the distended gut. Widespread connective tissue weakness is at the core, but not even mentioned in Mr Nathwani’s report.",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]

If she had simply said ""There are TWO bowel preps - Which one have you got?"" the confusion would have been avoided.
I think this would have been a better way to start rather than presumming which prep i had been given - just ask the patient - ""What does your box say"" or ""Which one have you got as different boxes require different instructions"".

What I will say is that Professor O’Brien and his secretary Samantha Mitchell were excellent. Sam was so kind and patient with me and she listened to me. I am morbidly obese and she did not judge me at all. She treated me as a human being with normal intelligence. So often people treat morbidly obese people as though their physical size makes them stupid. That’s why it’s so refreshing to talk to such a wonderfully lovely person like Sam. Cleveland is extremely fortunate to have such an employee.
Professor O’Brien was all of the above qualities that Sam has. He LISTENED to me. He treated me as a person with FEELINGS. He UNDERSTOOD that I have a brain and was intelligent!

The advice and support given to me by the facilitators was extremely powerful as they were able to explain how my coping mechanisms and the way I deal with my daughters behaviours affects the relationship. Having homework of trying new approaches based on the course content and discussing the result the following week was hugely beneficial as I was able to get feedback on why the scenario outcome was effective, backed up by the methods we had learnt.

The Cleveland Art Collection was impressive.  However, I gather that even the staff find it confusing as to which of they identical floors they are working on.

The service has been exceptional. Many thanks for your help in this pivotal part of my journey.

At the time I was grateful of time and advice offered but subsequently daughter re registered drs in essex, local drs confirmed all registered, and this was what Dr Masud said to do if staying in Essex and then could be treated at Basildon urgent care unit. 
Katie was visited by community Mental health team Weds as wanted to kill family and self, due to voices in head. Katie did not feel safe and community team wrote up notes and called ambulance to take her to the unit. But not much known about it when paramedics arrived and Katie kept in ambulance for an hour till confirmed could go to Basildon. Then spent 2 days and nights sleeping on floor of waiting room as Dr not avlb and no beds avlb. In saying that, first night given a sofa in room as deemed flight risk. But second night Katie said she wanted to jump off multi storey car park and I am advised was told they couldn't stop her as was there involuntary. Her boyfriend managed to persuade her against it. Then saw Dr Masud Fri 24/11 and apparently he said nothing he could , he had already told her go back to Cardiff and had spoken with Cardiff who said she ok last time they spoke with her.

5587,"I recently underwent a Septoplasty surgery performed by Dr. Jonathan Hughes, an ENT surgeon, at Cleveland Clinic London, and I must express my utmost gratitude for the outstanding care I received. Having had previous experiences with private healthcare, I thought I knew what to expect, but my time at Cleveland Clinic London exceeded all my expectations.  From the moment I arrived at the hospital, I was met with a level of professionalism and efficiency that left me truly impressed. I was promptly admitted at 7 am and escorted to my day case room, where I was made to feel comfortable and well-cared for by the attentive nursing team.  Before the surgery, I had the pleasure of meeting both Dr. Ahmad Ziyad, the Anesthetist, and Dr. Jonathan Hughes, my ENT Surgeon. They patiently answered all my questions, alleviating any concerns I had about the surgery and the recovery process. Their approachable and informative demeanor immediately put me at ease.  The surgery itself took place at 10:30 am, and I was pleasantly surprised to wake up post-op without any pain. Dr. Jonathan Hughes personally visited me, assuring me of the success of the surgery and outlining the next steps in my recovery. This information was reiterated by the nursing team once I returned to my room.  The hospital's pharmacy promptly provided me with painkillers, although I was relieved to find that I didn't require them immediately after the surgery. The culinary experience was also noteworthy, as I was served with food I had pre-selected from the menu pre-op.  After being discharged at 3 pm on the same day, a friend of mine who picked me up was equally impressed by the level of care and attention I received.  In conclusion, my experience at Cleveland Clinic London was nothing short of excellent. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I certainly would. The hospital's model of care felt more akin to a 5-star hotel than a medical facility. The caregivers were not only highly skilled but also remarkably friendly, making my stay comfortable and pleasant.  If you have the privilege of accessing private healthcare, I wholeheartedly recommend Cleveland Clinic London as your first choice.

I may have given the ICU nurses a hard time ;) while I was sedated, you guys were outstanding professionals. • My stay on the 5th floor recovery ward lasted around 2 weeks and it was incredible how comfortable the nursing staff made and my family feel. I felt like I was among friends and family rather than a hospital environment. Cassandra, Jenny, Victoria, Damien, Ela, Carmen, Rosa, Aris, Mackenzie (and Mackenzie American roommate whose name I now forget) blurred the lines between professionalism and going over and above to look after me.  • The care I received from Cassandra was super special – almost there by my bedside before I called for help, the most gentle and caring hands. Thank you Cass, you’re like my little daughter now. • And Jenny – thank you for arranging an air blower in the middle of the night. • The Health care assistants - Naomi, Frank, Riya – thank you for looking after me with such kindness. • Fellows/Doctors/Specialist Nurses – Helen Thompson, Joseph Okaphor, Artur Kowalczyk, Eric Jackson – your professionalism and care will always be remembered.  • I was super impressed by the structured preparation Jessica Bivand, Shola, Simone (phlebotomy  Cleveland’s Outpatient) provided – really helped build my confidence.

5771,"I visited Holly Wheelchair Service today (14/11/23) because I have been struggling with my current wheelchair (which was causing me physical pain) and which had become difficult for my carers and hospital staff to handle, which caused me significant guilt and reticence in terms of asking to use it (which in effect meant that I wasn't able to go out on the rare occasions on which I was well enough) and had become a somewhat intractable situation, particularly as my health and mobility has unfortunately continued to deteriorate and I needed help. 

The service over all was fantastic! I discussed my concerns with Penny via a telephone appointment who was compassionate, knowledgeable and most importantly listened to me and clearly wanted to help as much as possible and I then received an in person appointment within 2 months, which I feel is perfectly reasonable, given the current climate of relentless pressure on our NHS. I attended the appointment today and was surprised and frankly thrilled with the staff I met and how much these selfless and dedicated people wanted to help me. 

Firstly there was a slight delay, but for the first time ever in terms of potential delays, it wasn't a bad one! It was because they had taken the time to fully read my notes and they understood that I was immunocompromised and taking immunosuppressant medications and therefore wore a mask and David the Engineer for my appointment was hearing impaired and lip reads. So rather than cause any discomfort or awkwardness for me or just as importantly for him, they tried first to find ways to work around this, which was an unusual level of consideration Anywhere in todays society and refreshing to boot, I can't tell you how rare it is to experience that level of thoughtfulness from people.

This engendered me with trust and I felt completely safe and happy (on my own recognisance of course) to help my wheelchair engineer too help me, by removing my mask and I have to say, he blew me away. David was confident, reassuring, knowledgeable, personably kind, likeable and technically expert in his field. 

David communicated clearly, got down to the crux of the issues quickly and had me in a more appropriate and much more comfortable wheelchair very promptly, which he then set about proficiently adjusting to accommodate my physical condition. He made sure my footplates where correctly adjusted to accommodate for one leg being longer than the other due to spinal issues and installed my head rest (minutely to perfection) which I've never quite had right before, to account for the way my body is positioned and my need for head support as I become fatigued. 

For the first time ever I was truly comfortable in a chair which helped my self esteem issues about needing one in the first place and my posture was much healthier as well. I felt more secure and well positioned and the chair was much better for my duty carer to push and move around which made her happier as well. 

The chair did need some slight amendments however and both David and the Manager (who was also charming, polite, kind and helpful) sought to find a sensible solution within the constraints of the guidelines for us which they did achieve. 

I went home with a huge smile on my face and a much more comfortable attendant controlled wheelchair to use (I'm not able to operate a self propelled one), while a similar one with alterations is ordered / fabricated. I have a feeling my carers might be taking me out more (much to their chagrin) and it means less time bed or chair bound and most importantly, less pain. 

David really shone today in terms of clinicians and experts I've met during my deteriorating health and he must absolutely make his colleagues and peers, as well as his family proud I'm sure, because he certainly made me proud of Holly Wheelchair Service and the NHS today. He has a level of technical expertise and confidence seldom found in any field.

The support and kindness of the Manager as well, was so appreciated. I woke up today with extremely low blood pressure, unwell with the tail end of an infection and significant pain and therefore dreaded any appointment, but to my surprise I genuinely enjoyed my time at the service and left smiling and grateful for what we do have in terms of Healthcare Provision and for the first time in awhile not just melancholic about what we have lost. 

Thank You so much especially to David and indeed all the Staff and management at Holly Wheelchairs. Your jobs are clearly extremely difficult, but you do them so very well and it made a bigger difference to my wellbeing today, more than just the excellent chair alone. Apologies if this praise seems excessive or may be embarrassing to read, but I'm not one to keep my feelings quiet and it's how both I and my carer felt.

He was very rough, and I initially thought he was playing a joke, as he came  out with  the wheelchair at such a speed, slammed the footplates down, almost onto my feet, and then manhandled my feet onto the foot plates, very roughly indeed. I then asked him to stop that behaviour together with the nurse and asked him to calm down. The nurse kindly push the wheelchair as I think she felt worried that he was going to do that job and he took the baggage. I was feeling extremely vulnerable having just had a full knee replacement on the Monday.  I noticed going through a doorway, the bags fell over, and he roughly stacked them up again, and carried on, pushing them down to the street . When I got the bags out of the car, I noticed that the leather strap was broken on my Louis Vuitton hand luggage. I don’t mean to be causing any trouble for this gentleman. But if he was going to behave in this way with a truly vulnerable person, It would frankly be very worrying.

Upon my arrival at 8:10 am for an 8:30 am appointment, I found the reception area on the 2nd floor of Portland Place to be adequately staffed, with three individuals behind the desk, all wearing black shirts. Among them, Anna stood out as she was attentive and helpful throughout my visit. Her assistance during the scan was particularly appreciated.
However, I observed that the other two male staff members were engaged in casual conversations about TV shows, current news events, and miscellaneous topics, such as discussing the merits of different types of beards. They were also browsing through videos on their computer and mobile phones. One of the males, the Filipino gentleman, and the South Asian with a beard and glasses seemed to be particularly engrossed in their conversation, frequently bursting into laughter as they joked with each other. 
Their laughter and jokes seemed more suited to a social gathering rather than a professional healthcare environment. While their behavior did not significantly impact my experience since I was the only patient present at the time, I felt it important to bring to your attention as it may affect the professionalism perceived by other patients, especially during busier periods.
I understand that a relaxed atmosphere can sometimes contribute to a comfortable environment for patients, but maintaining a balance between friendliness and professionalism is crucial, especially in a healthcare setting.
Overall, I appreciate the service provided by Anna and the attention to my needs during the appointment. However, I believe addressing the behavior of the other staff members could enhance the overall patient experience at your facility.

To quote my doctor:  ""For this treatment, I would recommend she travel to UK for this treatment as we do not offer this treatment for her pain.  This would significantly improve her pain for long term versus just injection therapy.""

At Cleveland clinic, I was first taken through a spine surgeon, which I felt was not necessary but I went along with it, going for same tests (MRI's and CT scans) which I had done before and made it clear to the doctor that I have done this and had even been reviewed by a another spinal surgeon in the UK. After a two consultations and test, I was then taken to a pain specialist at Cleveland pain management clinic. This new doctor took me through two consultation and closed the process saying I should seek the same treatment (recommended by my Kenyan doctor) in Kenya, something that my Kenyan doctors clearly indicated that is not available in Kenya. 

 I feel very frustrated by Cleveland clinic since after more than 4 telephone/zoom consultations and expensive consultancy fees, they have abandoned me and not offered the treatment that I sought for. They just took me round and round without offering the help that I needed yet they have the capacity to help. I regret coming to cleveland clinic, I have wasted 4 months following up with the doctors only to be blocked out of getting the treatment I want.

It would appear that nobody had read my notes or understoood the requirements to perfom an MRI on a patient with severe curvature of the spine and with existing metal work in many joints.

The Cleveland have conducted Xrays, CT and MRI on me previously, with no problems. I am not a new patient.

I arrived for check in at the MRI suite at 14:01. After a great deal of too and fro, with copius note taking, it was explained to me that the Machine I shoud have been scanned in was being used by another patient - a patient that had they known my requirements, I was informed, could easily have been accommodated in the other, more powerful scanner. 

I sat around in a gown until 15:30, getting cold and worried.

When I was taken into the scanning room, unfortunately there was no pad or protection for my spine and because of my fixed curvature, they had to fit me into the scanner by raising my legs and buttocks with a wedge - this put extraordinary pressure on my spine. The whole procedure was uneccessarily stressful and excruciating - totally different to my experience for previous MRI at the Cleveland. The nurses and radiologist were all very concerned. After the procedure, I had to go straight to the toilet at which point I was just abandoned, left without any assistance, not even able to find the changing room. In the end I stopped a passing nurse and she showed me to the cooridor where the changing rooms were, but she wasn't sure which one was mine...Surly I should hav had a dedicated nurse to assist me until I was at least conducted to the changing room.

He offered various options for treatment, and referred me to a Sports medicine doctor. However I have to say that he did not respond to my questions in a manner that offered me any comfort.

I would particularly like to praise the use of the Adductor Canal Catheter which administered the Adductor Canal Block.  This made a huge difference to my pain control and recovery.  In fact I can honestly say that I have not felt any pain so far from the knee which was operated on.  To be able to get a good night's sleep each night meant I was stronger and more able to focus on my recovery as each day passed.

I was then told that I was not the next person but there was 1 patient before me.

The consultant had been delayed dealing with the patient before me.

I explained that as my husband was waiting for me and we had over 2 hour drive home this was not very convenient and I had been told I was the next patient when I arrived.

The nurses said they would speak to my consultant who then arranged for me to be the next patient and my procedure started about 4pm.

Before the procedure the nurse started putting pads on me for an ECG.I asked why she was doing this and she explained that it was necessary of a patient was having a general aneasthetic.I explained I was having sedation.

Another nurse then appeared and confirmed I was having sedation and not a general so she took off the pads.

This was not a major problem for me but since you asked perhaps the nurses should read the notes more carefully?

Also perhaps the nurses should pop in every half hour or so to let me know what was happening whilst i was waiting for the procedure rather than leave me on my own for nearly an hour and a half?

6242,"I will pick out four areas if concern. 

The CNS staff should be proactive, knowledgeable and able to anticipate problems. For example, when I came up from  surgery I was told to drink lots of fluid to flush out the medications, so I did. But the bed was high, the floor was beautifully shiny and the bathroom was a longish way away for an exhausted old man. I had great difficulty in getting without falling; I am stiff and wobbly at the best of times, and that day I was dizzy as well.  The nurse at the time, Wilma, was very sweet and kind and helpful but not knowledgeable.  She offered to help me back and forth by holding my arm.  But she is small and I am big and heavy, so that kind of help was not what I needed.  I should have had handrails into and out of the bathroom and a walker [zimmer frame].  But I have never used one and did not  think of it.  Eventually, hours later,  a friendly technician (not a nurse) heard this story, suggested a zimmer frame and promised to bring one.  Then he went  away and never came back!  My hazardous shuffles across the slippery floor continued.  All UNNECESSARY.  Why does  a post-op nurse not only not know what I am likely to need but not have the correct equipment ready?   Surely the hospital  cannot be drumming up fracture repair business? 

All the pharmaceutical staff should be able to distinguish between a patient who understands his medications and one who is not well enough to do that.  In advance of the operation, I had a long telephone chat with one, Ms Pang?, who was really first class and  gave me expert and helpful advice.    My doctor, Dr Richard Cohen, had warned me that I might  have to stay in for one night after the procedure, and advised that I come prepared.  So I had all my routine medications very neatly laid out in morning,  afternoon, evening and emergency plastic bags, in sequence, in my small suitcase.  But then a cheerful and brisk pharmacist arrived,  unfortunately while my wife was  out of my room, and announced that she would be taking all my medications away until I was discharged!

That really scared me. The drugs were my whole stock.  It is hard to see my GP, hard to get NHS medications on time, and especially hard to cope on weekends.  I really need my stock.  I think she could not tell that  I am normally compos mentos, so she  may have thought that I am always too old and feeble to understand. But at that time I was still full of anaesthesia and too weak  to get out of bed and defend my property,   I begged her to leave my drugs alone and explained that she could check them just by looking through the clear  plastic at each item without disturbing their orderly layout, but she was determined to take charge. Luckily she eventually left without taking my pills away, but not until she had ransacked my suitcase to find them and write them all down. That exact job had already been done in complete, accurate detail and at great length by Ms Pang a week earlier. I did try to explain that I might be leaving that evening and I needed my medications, but she left without explaining what the future held for me. 

It was a bewildering session and I was not fit enough at the time to cope with it.  

A  shortcoming worth emphasising was the chaotic  discharge procedure. The surgeons and the later the ward doctor confirmed  that we  could go home at the end of the day of the procedure and said at he would tell the nurses what to give me to take home.  My wife went to the nurses station in mid-afternoon to start the process and a nurse checked me and said they would discharge me.  By teatime nothing happened so my wife went to ask about things, and they said the paperwork was in process.  That went on for some time, and we eventually left at about 7 pm. The nurses must have been badly overworked that day?  We were given a discharge sheet but not the medication the doctor had ordered, and it was promised but did not come.  My wife  asked several times but it still did not come so eventually  we just left anyway.  One  of  the nurses, Veronica, ran after us down to the street entrance with it.  But then, once in the car my wife remembered that the doctor  had also promised us a set of dressings, so she went all the way back to the ward to get them from the nurses' station. They provided them.  

The fourth item worth mentioning is that we needed a follow-up professional check on the operation site, its dressing and what we needed to do for wound care. We had to ask for it;  it was not taken for granted as routine (? Maybe it is not  considered necessary?)  Anyway, we asked if it could be done in outpatients  rather than the hospital, and they said fine.   Even the ward doctor was involved in setting it up and  assured us it was arranged.  But.. the next day, having lost faith in the CC bureaucracy, I phoned Portland Place to check and they said I had no booking at all.  After lots of phone  calls we got  a meeting with CNS nurse who was fine, but it took effort on our part.  It seems that communication between the two parts of the hospital is of low  quality.",[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

Are we perhaps a little too full of ourselves? Please don't! A little less arrogance, a bit more punctuality and professionalism.  So please stop talking without commiting to when things can take place. e.g. when a particular course of therapy can begin. YOUR patients wellbeing might depend on that. Do you care?

6418,"I'd like some help or suggestion on how to get through and find the important info / feelings memory's that matter faster so I don't use up sessions

Provide Information that clears up assumptions about the therapy, for example that they don't write most of what you're saying so you can't have a write up or time line of your life as per my sessions. 
I think that would be very Helpful for reference etc. To remind yourself of the positive Resolutions you came to, for when the negative thoughts returned. Both the therapist and client are having to concentrate during sessions so a way of keeping the transcript would be helpful. If transcripts are to sensitive the it would be quick and easy to pick out the key points from having it all in front of you. The key points could then be shared after each session via email.

I leant as I went along the skill required to be successful at therapy.

6646,"Initially, I was apprehensive about speaking to Marcin, being that he is male and I had always spoken to a woman about these things but I have never been so wrong. Marcin is, even from the very beginning, punctual to our appointments and gentle but direct with his questions. He is always very sympathetic and genuinely listens, he does not generalize what I say or disregards any of my feelings, as I have previously experienced even going to private professionals. I am so shocked and completely grateful that this is on the NHS. Marcin is apologetic on other professionals' behalf who have not taken my mental health seriously and I whole-heartedly wish I could have spoken to him years ago before my bipolar developed. Having bipolar makes my judgment of situations and people distorted but I am not unsure when I say that I can rely on Marcin´s support and commitment to getting me every bit of help and advice that he has access to. Genuinely, I cried after our first appointment - not from my bipolar but because I felt that it was the first time in my whole life that someone didn't just hear what I said, but actually listened and I could never express how grateful my family and I are for everything he continues to do for me. Our appointments are never rushed, they are always filled with useful helplines and strategies and I feel he is on MY side for once in this system. If there is any way Marcin could receive the greatest praise or recognition, then I hope whoever reads this entitles him to it. Marcin is passionate about this line of work, and it shows in how much time he puts into discussing me with colleagues and trying to get the help from psychiatrists and specialists that he recommends. For once, even in my lowest, I see more hope now I have Marcin to help not just me, but many others in my situation. When I speak with him, it is always professional but never like I am being questioned or quizzed as I have experienced with other senior doctors. I never feel like a statistic or that I am who I am because of my bipolar. Marcin once told me how proud he was of me, and how proud I should be to wake up each day and tackle the symptoms that I experience. Marcin also told me that I am strong and that he is sorry nobody ever listen to me when I was too young to understand what I had gone through.",[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1.]

Sometimes I felt nurses weren’t as prompt or exact with when I was expecting them. On one occasion a nurse had come to take readings 10-15 minutes after a nurse had already taken them which was a bit confusing. It made me wonder if there was a lack of a scheduling system.

I think there should be a written schedule that gets presented to a patient and or family that outlines when you can generally expect to be visited and by what type of staff. Even if the timings are not exact and subject to some change. 

After my CT scan I was anxious to hear back about it and it felt like it wasn’t acknowledged how and when I would hear about it. After asking a nurse about the CT scan, they were able to say that the CT scan had returned but could not effectively comment on the results other than say it was ‘differential’. That lead to some anxiety for myself and also my mother and sister who were with me at the time. It was late in the evening which was not ideal to be left with questionable results. It might have been preferable for him to just say they were not ready or available to interpret.

I know I can ask for further help but it took 8 months to get to this stage and I then wonder is there any point.

Sadly is has all come down to resources and that is why I did feel guilty for taking a slot that someone more deserving perhaps could use.

6848,"It was not ideal having four people in a small and almost windowless room for James’ first meeting with you.

Also concerned that James’ medical records for the second meeting - where you saw James alone - include the words “James denies any problems with sleeping or eating”

James has a long standing sleep disorder, which he reported to Marcin Prochnicki on 26th May 2022, as stated in Mr Prochnicki’s records of that consultation. He quotes James saying:Very poor sleep… never had a good sleep. Appears to be linked to inability to switch off…”
 
Also, James does have some issues with when and what he eats, and was receiving therapy for this from Health and Well-being Coach Sophie Cooper at his GP surgery from 25th March 2022 to 17th June 2022.
 
So it seems unlikely that James would mean to say that he had no problems with sleeping or eating when he saw you that second time.

Stop squeezing stocks of medication, linen, gowns etc. Suggest where patients have special things that need doing that a ready use box/locker of all the relevant supplies kept next to the patient so nurses don’t have to go off on a hunt for them - could have a volunteer to keep stocks in locker topped up.

8319,"More training about working with people who have ‘normal trauma’ plus ‘lived trauma’ from being undiagnosed or late diagnosed neuro diverse and being held to the standards of a normal person without daily struggles.  

I struggle with not only a traumatic childhood and part adulthood but also executive functioning.  So any trauma related work needs to be done together with daily functioning.  Any thing that can effect my mood will have an effect on my ability to care for myself.

Transitions are very difficult for people with audhd (adhd and autism combined) so trying to move on from a therapy session into normal day life is hard. I need support in doing this with most things.  Anything that causes me intense emotions wipes me out for days.

Labelling emotions is hard for me, as a neurodiverse person I have never understood or felt the plethora of emotions my peers seem to feel.  Everything feels the same to me, either very intense or nothing at all and good things can feel intense or nothing and so can bad things, it’s an intensity i am aware of not a nicely defined emotion.

My memories are very scattered.  I remember traumatic experiences as a child like an old film or snap shots.  I remember the feeling of being so scared that I would shut myself off from the word mentally and wake up hours later.  This still happens at times now, if I am emotionally provoked, which can be from people or even tv.  So I avoid both new people and new tv programmes.

Sameness helps me stay on top of things but any change in my routine can cause me to shut down.  Also the boredom of sameness can make me shut down.  Again this is so difficult to live with and articulate or manage. 

I know what I need to do to become well, I’ve read and listened to everything I can get my hands on.  What I can’t do is get out of the constant burnout I get from people treating me like I’m neuro typical and then getting upset with me for responding in a neurodiverse manner, this happens a lot at previous employers/schools/therapy.  I struggle with daily reminders of traumatic experiences that I’ve encountered because of being vulnerable but looking normal.  The emotional flashbacks feel worse to me because I don’t understand what’s happening and I have no clear memories of what’s happened until sometime later when I do get the visual component. 

I feel like I live in a bubble but I want to live in the world and I can’t manage it",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

We have received help from other nurses and doctors from different hospitals and teams, Sue is simply the best and beyond amazing, because she not only cares about her little patient, she really can think out of the box to make these little ones’ life less miserable. She is so accurate and fast doing bloods without missing any details, most of the cases even before our daughter realised what has happened, it’s already done. And the dressings she has done for our daughter, we had no problems at all and they can last the whole week even in hot days. We have closely observed how different people would do the dressing, and we understand this might be a very simple routine thing for Sue, but clearly she thought through all the steps and every time adjust what she does for different situations. She also think ahead for us, for her it’s not just about that day that minute she does her job and puts that massive sticker on a crying baby, she thinks about what the skin would be like for the rest of the week and what kind of problems we might have. 
Our daughter has been traumatised by the treatments and different hospitals stays etc etc so she is very very shy around the medics and anyone apart from us and her Granny, but she would let Sue give her a cuddle and they also play little games,  which was just amazing to see.

want to be around. It took a while to get TT,

8410,"My 7 year old son had been referred to Occupational Therapy for Sensory issues/potential Dyspraxia (as well as having been referred to the ADHD pathway separately).

We attended one appointment earlier this year, were provided with some printouts regards sensory issues for ourselves and his school and asked to go away and put in place some of this advice. We were also told at that appointment that we would be followed up and that a school visit would be undertaken by the OT team once Zachariah had settled into his new year group at school this term. These are the things I assumed we would be discussing today.

We were sent a letter, dated 22nd June, for an appointment today 12th October at 11:30am to see his OT for a further face to face sensory session and not only had I booked the day off of work to attend this appointment, I had arranged his absence with the school and prepared Zachariah for the appointment. He struggles with high anxiety around situations like this and this has taken some time.

I am therefore absolutely appalled to have received a phone call today to tell me that this appointment is cancelled and that you no longer offer this service. This is disgraceful.and absolutely appalling.

How can you now 'not offer this service' - this is child occupational therapy. When was this service provision removed bearing in mind the letter with our appointment is only dated from this summer - were you ever going to announce this or tell the parents of these children? Have GP surgeries been made aware you no longer offer OT sessions for children?

My child desperately needs help with these issues and to have one appointment and be told we would be followed up and have a school visit, and then to be told on the day of the appointment that this service doesn't even exist any longer is a farce.

Please take this as an official complaint. It is simply not good enough. What will now happen to my child? Is he just left to deal with these things on his own? I understand from my husband who called the OT this morning that we will be offered a 'parents workshop'. What on earth do you think this will achieve? All children going to OT are going to have very different needs for very different reasons which manifest completely differently in various situations, often complex. This is simply a cost cutting exercise to stop seeing children face to face but it seems to have been a decision made by 'stealth' as we have not received a single notification of this. 

I would like a full investigation into this and also an explanation as to what will now happen to my child and his needs - are we just 'dealing with it' until further notice? Should I ask my 7 year old just to fix himself for a few months because the Lighthouse powers that be don't see children with his needs anymore? How should I explain this to him exactly? What are we supposed to tell his school? Should I personally advise on how to incorporate OT into his daily education schedule? Are we just now for want of a better expression 'winging' helping children?

This is absolutely not okay and I want to make clear that I will be taking this further. You have badly let my child (and our family) down and I am disgusted.

Kind regards, Fiona Brown

8411,My Clinician was Lisa Berg of whom I cannot speak highly enough. She made me feel comfortable immediately to such an extent that she was the only person I have been able to cry to during the very worst experience of my life. It was a truly traumatic and distressing experience I went through but there was nothing I couldn’t say to Lisa. She was extraordinarily knowledgable in so many areas. Her practical help has been invaluable. She was always so kind but also a sense of humour at the right time that was so helpful. I truly feel very very lucky to have had Lisa by my side. She showed such patience and would try different ways to get her point across for me to understand her message. She is truly remarkable in her work. I will remember her for many things and one that stands out is her enthusiasm for her work and making each person feel special as she is!,[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]

There was poor communication with the family. 

The physio he was promised was merely walking to the door and back. 

Things that were promised, by doctors, did not happen. In fact, my mum had to sort one of the major things herself. 

He was left in a wet bed over night, after a bottle he had used for the toilet tipped. Two members of your staff had an argument in front of my dad about whether a wet bed should be changed immediately or wait until the morning. Upon further investigation, it appears it is your protocol to leave elderly patients in a wet bed all night until the morning shift arrive. 

On his final morning, in your so called care, he asked for a bottle to got the toilet and was told there were none and he was expected to wet himself, which he had to. This is appalling and humiliating. As a family, we are astonished that this was allowed to happen. Who do I need to speak to, to take this further?",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]

Once the Continence Service became involved they did their utmost to try to support me with this. It still took a long time to resolve and l eventually found a pad myself that met my Daughter’s needs. This wasn’t available on the Home Delivery Service and so the Continence service tried many avenues to try to secure funding for it.They were very empathetic to the problem and how this affected my Daughter’s life and were very proactive in trying to resolve it.

8526,"My experience of therapy 4u+ was overwhelmingly positive so this is difficult to answer , however not suggesting improvement seems a disservice so I will mention the obvious constraints and potential area's of growth. 

(1) More therapists/resources in order to reduce the waiting list times, it can be years before therapy comes through and whilst that is an overall NHS demand issue ,clients often have no input beyond medication whilst waiting for therapy. Most medications particularly high level ones are meant to be used/started in conjunction with therapy for full benefit.  People can feel abandoned and like there situation is hopeless when they are on a long or undetermined length waiting list. I waited 4 years for an alternative therapy, and my mental health deteriorated significantly in that time, as did my ability to function at home and fully perform at work. I feel lucky that therapy 4u+ once referred only took close or just over a year. 

(2) Capacity for longer term therapy for those benefitting or in need 
(beyond the current 20 maximum). I have PTSD , severe depression and anxiety from a significant trauma background which I imagine is not uncommon in clients. 20 sessions was enough to start making progress for me which is a big step, but I certainly could have benefitted from further sessions. I appreciate this can be a hard balancing act in terms of both resources and also ensuring a long list of people all get seen in a reasonable timeframe. 

In conclusion Therapy 4u+ was painfully difficult and challenging at times, but productive and the first positive step in a very long time for me.  It restored my faith in the therapeutic process and I would be able to be more open in any further therapy in future as a result of the positive experience with therapy 4u+. The only thing I would wish to change is having started to make such progress, would have been to have been able to continue longer term.

8529,"My experience was awful and has taken me months to be able to give feedback as I was so upset. My sessions were with Deborah De Marco De cruz. She was low in empathy and high in judgement and was a terrible listener. I would get one sentence out (literally) and she would interrupt and shut the conversation down. If it is a rule that I am only allow to talk when asked a question, it would have been helpful to explicitly state that rather than be so dismissive and insensitive. There were no listening skills present (I've had therapy before outside of the NHS) which would have helped, no summarising, paraphrasing, reflection etc. Only questions, that she didn't really listen to the answers to. She was constantly putting words in my month from her assumptions and second guessing ( she is a terrible mind reader). Every attempt to try and say "" I dont think that"" or try to explain my experience, she would double down and tell me I do think what she has decided I should think. This meant future questions she would ask would direct me further away from my experience and were even less helpful to me as they seem to reflect only her agenda (it was confusing to me who the process was even for). This hasn't just kept me stuck , this has set me back. My thoughts, feelings and experiences are not acceptable (I'm not acceptable), there not worth listening to and I have to pretend/perform to not be a disappointment, developing an extra layer or shame, pushing things down further. I brought up nearly every session that I feel unsafe, she dismissed it every time. I just kept hoping it would get better....how dumb am I?
So many tools started and never finished. Initial sessions were over the phone so I was taking notes. The tool for my 'maintenance' was never even mentioned at any point. I asked for an extra session to try and finish/understand some of the tools ( she did give my that extra session). A futile attempt to try and get something out of these sessions. The only reason I could complete the longitudinal formulation was because of previous therapy.
I feel hopeless!  NHS therapy i have experienced relies heavily on manipulation. If the 'therapist' really  believed in the therapy wouldn't they focus more on being a half decent therapist?

8540,"My experiences were frustrating at times. After receiving notification from Mr Eriksson's assistant that she was moving to this clinic, I used the email address to contact them to book an appointment. I received no reply, so sent another email. I received a reply to this, asking to speak on the phone. I replied asking if I could arrange the appointment by email, as I was travelling at the time but didn't really care to further delay discussing my test results with the doctor. I received no reply. I called when I returned from travel and arranged an appointment. I explained in writing and on the phone that the appointment was to discuss the findings of the sleep study. I called the hospital that conducted the study to check it had been sent, which they stated it had. I also tried to call Dr Eriksson's assistant to check the study had been received but could not get through. Whilst waiting for the appointment, I received multiple calls about payment for the appointment, despite this not being mentioned when I booked the appointment. This necessitated another call to the clinic to pay. I asked for an invoice to seek reimbursement and explained that this required details about the care provided (despite this being highly standardized practice in private care). I was told it would be sent automatically and would include details about the care. I did not however receive any documentation, which required another call to the clinic. I then received a receipt, which provided no detail about the care provided and will be in no way suitable for my insurer. Addressing this issue has required further contact with the clinic, is not yet resolved and, I have no doubt, will require more calls during the work day.  

When I spoke with the physician, she had no idea I had the sleep study and did not have the results, despite my efforts to follow up with both the hospital and her assistant. Whilst I appreciate effort was made to get the report quickly and call me back, it is not overly convenient for me to go in and out of video calls during the working day. Also having results discussed in this rushed way does not really project confidence that a considered clinical interpretation has been made, although I did not find any major issues with the standard of care and advice given.  

Whilst the staff at the clinic have been very friendly and polite, I have a very busy life and it is difficult to take time out of the working day to make multiple calls for one basic consultation. Having care delivered in a disorganized way, which requires me to chase up many different elements, just doesn't really work for me. Moreover, I think it is highly reasonable to expect a minimum degree of client orientation when you pay high consultation charges.",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

Kathy also encouraged me to have a one to one session when she felt I needed it and that helped me greatly,

Initially he worked towards gaining my trust enabling my trauma to be unlocked, addressed and put into conscious reality - painful and terrifying as it was, ‘Feeling the fear and doing it anyway’ has been a life saving mind set as I have continued to go through repeated incidents of trauma. He never made me feel uncomfortable at any stage of my journey.

8667,"My therapy was delivered via video calls on Teams; that's a good system and worked well; but I some times have to travel and I work on several different computers at different times.  Early on in therapy I had the link saved on one of my personal laptops, but later on I ended up needing to use my work laptop instead because I didn't have the personal laptop with me; the problem is that I didn't have the link saved on my work laptop and it was a nightmare frantically digging through months worth of old emails trying to find the one with the link!  Then right at the end I needed to do the video call on a new personal laptop that also didn't have the Teams link saved on it, so I had the same problem again and Dot needed to resend me the link.  As a result I ended up joining the meeting significantly later than I would have if I had had the link to hand when I needed it.

What could you do differently here?  I think that all of the e-mails about upcoming sessions should contain a copy of the link to the video call.

At the outset our doctor seemed uncertain what this included and called in a nurse to establish whether it included a Cardio Stress Test. It did. I was then left with 20 minutes of my consultation, which seemed rushed, although I had and still have a high regard for the Doctor concerned. I then had to wait for two hours before my blood tests and cardio tests were ready, I took the cardio test naked to the waist, with ECG leads and blood pressure monitors attached, while four members of staff and a representative from the computer hardware firm looked on!

So that was 3 hours plus wasted.   Next time it went fairly smoothly.

Then a couple of weeks later we returned to the Cleveland Clinic to discuss with the specialist - that went more smoothly although when my husband and I left, I still felt that I was unsure of exactly what I had been told.

9304,"On Wednesday 22nd September I had a consultation with Prof Rinaldi as a self-paying client to assess my post ICD removal/replacement which Prof Rinaldi had carried out. As part of the assessment Prof Rinaldi requested a number of blood tests and before these were carried out the Patient Access Team (?) took great care to discuss with me the costs involved. On the basis of these discussions I agreed to carry the costs of the C Reactive Protein and FBC & Auto Differential tests as I knew these to be of immediate importance especially in view of my forthcoming tooth extraction. The other two (more expensive) tests, Blood Culture and Urea & Electrolytes, I undertook to organise through my GP surgery. I accordingly paid for these two tests and for the Prof’s consulting fee.
After these two blood tests had been carried out I was on my way out of the Clinic when I was asked by a staff member if I had really meant “not to have my ICD device checked”. I was unaware that this had been requested by Prof Rinaldi but immediately agreed to have it done as it could clearly be of importance.
The check was carried out by two technicians and took about half an hour – perhaps a bit longer as there was plenty of good natured banter between us. During the procedure one of the technicians happened to remark that I would now not need to go to have the normal post-implant ICD check at St Thomas’ as they had already done the necessary work.
After the ICD check I was asked to collect the Invoice from the downstairs office, which I did. What I did not expect was an Invoice for £480, an amount I was unable to meet then and there.
On a number of grounds I feel something has gone seriously wrong here.
1.	Unlike with the blood tests, I was never informed of the cost of the ICD check before it was done nor was it ever discussed with me. 
2.	If I had been informed of the cost I would absolutely not have agreed to proceed – unless Prof Rinaldi had insisted it was absolutely essential to do it right then and there.
3.	I simply cannot relate the cost of the ICD check to the amount of work involved. Has some costing error perhaps crept in here?
4.	I feel uneasy about being charged £480 for an ICD test that I was going to receive in 3 weeks’ time at no cost from Prof’s cardiac team at St Thomas’.

While in retrospect it is clear that I should have asked in advance about the cost of the  ICD check it simply never crossed my mind that this would be necessary. In the ~12 years I have had an ICD implant this is the first time I have ever been charged for an ICD system check.",[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

When re-directed to the correct floor, the nurse who was kind and compassionate took a very long time to take my blood pressure and do an ECG. She even asked if I wanted a coffee/tea just as I was wired up to an ECG ! Kindly meant but totally inappropriate moment. She did not seem clear as to what was required for my apt and kept having to check with Prof Lambiase and incurring delay.  I then had to interrupt my apt to go back for a further test which should have been done at the start.
I was at the clinic for 1hour 15mins in total and ideally I had planned for 15 mins pre-apt tests and 30mins with Prof Lambiase.
However, I consider myself very fortunate to be under Prof Lambiase's care and it is worth every minute.

We were escorted to the MRI waiting space and again it felt like we were in a prison! Although my mum is clearly elderly, no one spoke up so she could hear them behind their masks and I had to ask them to do so several times.  The changing room was cold and there were no hangers (locker 3) and just a locker for my mum. The toilet had no loo paper and the loo roll that had been put in there was put on the floor but was so far away from the toilet - she had to get up to get it. Both the loo and the changing room looked like building works were on-going.

Overall it was the cold and the lack of comfort in the MRI changing room.  When she was offered tea - it arrived in a cardboard cup - again not what an 85  year old expects when we 'go private', we are used to  5 star at London Clinic or King Edward 7th.  

My personal complaint is the digital platform - fine (although irritating) for my generation but mum just wants an email - no logging on and off - she has cancer, she is 85 and to have anything in a hospital that is unaccessible seems badly thought out. For example on Tuesday she has a ZOOM with her Dr - However instead of sending her a simple Zoom link, she would have to log into this platform - I will be at work and was planning on logging in with her but now it looks like this is also inaccessible for her.",[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

9328,"On the telephone call prior to admission, I was told that on the day of the procedure I would be allowed to have my husband with me, especially to help me as a translator, which didn't happen as he was asked to wait outside. The nurse then, told my husband that she only would need me initially for a brief period of time and that I would soon be back to the waiting area before being admitted for the procedure, which also didn't happen and my husband wasn't even informed about this change of plans.

During admission, I informed the nurse that my nose was severely blocked due to hay fever and that I was concerned that it might be a problem during the procedure. The nurse then advised me she would speak to the endoscopist and check the implications of that but before I knew I was being taken to the procedure room without any answers regarding this matter. It was only inside the procedure room that, since no one took the time to ask the endoscopist, I raised the question myself as I was concerned that my nose being blocked would cause me trouble breathing during the procedure. The consultant told me that it shouldn’t be a problem as I would breathe through my mouth, but as soon as the nurse applied the anaesthetic spray to my throat I started having difficulty breathing, especially in the position they wanted me to be in. As I moved my head gasping for air, I realised I hadn’t removed my earrings and as I was removing one of them, one of the nurses took the other earring off my other ear and my glasses off my face without even asking, which got me very stressed as I realised that I wasn’t being treated with respect.

During the telephone call prior to the procedure, I mentioned to the nurse that, even though I didn’t have a mobility issue per se, I had a surgical procedure in the recent past that was still causing mobility restrictions and pain. The nurse reassured me that on the day of the procedure this would be taken into account and that I would be able to assume a position that I would be more comfortable for me to be in. Unfortunately, no one seemed to be aware of that on the day and even though, already in the procedure room, I explained the situation to the nurses they didn’t seem to know what to do with that information or they didn’t simply care at all, as they required me to be in the position that was easier for the procedure to be performed and pulling my head back into position while I was trying to breathe.

For the procedure itself, even though I have had the same procedure done twice in the past, I was thoroughly informed that there were three possible ways to go ahead and I specifically gave consent for the procedure to be done under conscious sedation, as I had for my previous endoscopies, so I was already familiar with how the procedure should go.

Although the sedative was given, neither the consultant nor the nurses waited for the medication to work. Even before the medication was handed to the consultant, one of the nurses put my head back in position and put the mouthguard on me even though I was struggling to breathe and it caused such severe stress that I started frenetically bitting the mouthguard while the consultant without even looking at me asked the nurse for the sedative and, as soon as the endoscopist applied the medication on my vein, he got the procedure started. Because of this lack of professionalism and patience to wait for the medication to take effect I could feel the endoscope being forced through my mouth and oesophagus and while I saw the consultant moving the equipment to get better images I could feel the movement of the tube inside of me as the procedure was being performed.",[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

9377,"One thing that I think you should consider. I have visited both Portland Place and Grosvenor Place twice now and had numerous telephone conversations in between from both places. The staff I have dealt with are very professional and always polite. But believe they over use the word of ‘sir’ when dealing with patients. On one phone call the word ‘sir’ was used six or more times. During an ECG it was used at least four times. 
The word ‘sir ‘ is very generic and I found a little demeaning for your staff. Also not sure it really provides the confidence you seek. 
I believe the use of one’s name is much more professional and of course very personal. It offers just that that extra reassurance and personal touch that makes all the difference. 
For example……”are you feeling comfortable Mr. Gottschalk” is far better than saying “ are you feeling comfortable Sir”. It’s personal to me and how I feel. When you are called “Sir” you know that they do that to everyone and therefore looses its impact. 
When I asked the nurse who set up my ECG why he kept calling me sir ….his answer was habit. So in essence I was right……if you call everyone sir it just looses its impact as you know he calls everyone the same. Cleveland aim must be ( I assume ) is to make patients feel very special…….by calling them by name achieves one of those objectives instantly……..but not to be over used.

9470,"Overall I felt safe and relaxed. I was relieved to be in my condition at a hospital whereas at home I was beginning to feel scared of the increasing severity of symptoms. During my stay here, I had some manageable levels of stress and anxiety. 

 My admission was swift and it felt like I was being attended to for my initial tests and induction with good haste. 

Nurses were present and courteous throughout. At times they seemed under pressure and curt but not unfriendly.

I was very sleep deprived and was not as decisive with taking on additional treatments such as a nebuliser and sleeping tablets. In general I was not as articulate or concise about how I was feeling. Ideally I would have wanted the nurses to be more assuring about my use of them and not be as passive. I’ve had to rely on my family presence to advocate and explain for me whilst here. It contributed to some anxiety about not giving myself the best chance of recovery. 

My cough was interrupting sleep which lead to a sense that I was heading into a vicious cycle where I wasn’t getting rest and thus worsening my infection. 

During the night of Tuesday and Wednesday morning I was in a poor condition with my cough at its worse and unable to find any resting position. My 6am IV treatment and blood samples were unpleasant. In retrospect i do not feel the nurse gave ideal or comforting assurance during this low period of my stay.

I did feel if I had not asked I might still be sitting there. It became apparent that I should have been sent to the 5th floor reception where I would have been checked into my room and taken to my procedure from there (which is what I expected to happen).  This meant that my case and clothes had to go from the basement to the resus room and only then to my room on the 5th floor when I did.

I have an issue with pre treatment.  I could not get a date and address for the clinic before I went to the trouble to fill in the website form, think of a password etc.  I should have had a communication as well as this form giving that information.
I did not receive any information before Monday 14th August and the treatment was on Wednesday, 16th August.
I had no clue that I would have to spend so long in hospital and that the process would take so long because this had not been explained in advance AT ALL. 
It was only lucky I could get hold of the individual who I had organised to accompany me home to explain that she needed to be there at 18:30 and not 15:30.
The menu looked very good and the food was nutritious.  I liked the hospital staff but I noticed the individual who took my food order did not have a sufficiently good level of English to understand me.  I asked for a strawberry milkshake and expected a sweet drink.  I received liquidised strawberries in milk.  It was nice, it was nutritious but as I felt I deserved a treat I was disappointed a bit.  Still- everyone has to learn, eh?
On Monday 15th August an individual conducted an on-phone assessment pre-admission.  She asked me my address.  The records showed the wrong address.  I told her the right address giving the postcode B for Brava D for Delta etc and when I filled in the Cleveland Clinic form I checked and the address there was completely wrong.  I don’t mind correcting someone’s mistake but the right address is important and I think a less able/ more sick patient may not have noticed the mistake.",[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

9785,"Portland Place Clinic. (I haven't been to Grosvenor Place yet)

Building was very clean. Staff were all very polite and very nice and helpful.

On a minor note, I have to say that the ground floor waiting room and the first floor waiting room were both rather bleak with very stylish but very uncomfortable seating. Some other patients who were waiting agreed that first floor sofas and chairs were particularly uncomfortable, springy and slippery. 

It would have been nice to have a tea/coffee machine actually in the waiting rooms as other clinics have but there were none. Reception staff were very kind in bringing a cup of tea but in a paper cup (horrible ) and I felt rather a nuisance asking them as I am sure that they have better things to do.

The female radiographer for my echocardiogram was very kind and extremely efficient and gave me a very precise instructions as to when to breathe in, breathe out, and hold my breath. But towards the end of the session, she asked her male colleague to come in and take some more pictures. He did so but only told me to breathe out so I had no idea when to breathe in. I have no wish to ruin his pictures so I did as he said but three times I was left holding my breath and gasping. In normal circumstances this would be most amusing but not having specific instructions as to when to breathe in made things very hard for me and exhausting.",[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.]

Re-examine myself as a whole person, meant that I could challenge my own thoughts to find a constructive way forward, by accepting things I cannot change and finding a positive way forward, which would benefit  my own wellbeing for my physical and mental health.
 At 75 it is not easy to accept change, but realise, unless I do, it would have had a detrimental effect on myself and my family  at a time when I need them the most.

It was not all sadness, the smiles and sense of humour was very much appreciated which help to lift my spirits when applied at the right time.
I never realised until now what an important the role of a therapist plays and hope that I never need one again, but know where to come if I do.

10734,"Some members of staff were absolute angels. They comforted me when distressed and provided me with a listening ear when I needed it. Sadly, they were few and far between. On many occasions I was left to cry alone for hours, as staff were too busy either dealing with other ""severely unwell"" patients or hiding in the office filling out paperwork.

I have a primary diagnosis of EUPD and it is heavily stigmatised, even by health professionals. Especially by the consultant on Grangewaters at the time, 2019 (Dr. Mundemphilly), who took me off all my medication (which was ineffective) but refused to try anything different, claiming ""medication doesn't work for EUPD"". Which is clearly untrue, because as soon as I was transferred to Cygnet, the consultant there immediately started me on three or four new medications to stabilise my symptoms.

Mundemphilly also tried to discharge me when I was still desperately suicidal. I ended up taking a huge overdose of quetiapine whilst still on the ward (half a box of tablets that I had managed to steal from the hatch one meds time because the nurse turned his back for several minutes and left it on the counter. And they never even noticed it was missing!) and I ended up in ICU. It got noted as a failed discharge.

One of my methods of self-harm was severe head-banging. Often I was left to continue without support. On one such occasion, I was left for a full hour with no help whatsoever.  The NIC told all the staff to ""leave me to it"". Even my 1:1 who was meant to be observing and providing support just sat there and watched me violently hurl myself at the wall, blood pooling at my feet. And I am on long term blood thinners, so there was a risk of internal bleeding to the brain. Despite this, they didn't send me for a CT scan afterwards and I had to wait until 6am the next morning to see the on-call doctor (and that was only after my father phoned the ward to put pressure on them to get me examined - they didn't listen to my pleas). Interestingly, immediately after the incident, and once I had exhausted myself self-harming, I tried to take photographs on my phone to provide evidence to make a complaint. Well I would have done so, if it weren't for the fact they confiscated my phone (as they often did whenever I had an incident, as a form of punishment) and refused to hand it back until I'd cleaned the blood off the wall and floor. They knew of my intention to try to gather evidence, and eventually cleaned it up themselves, before finally handing my phone back. When I then posted on social media to vent my experience,  somehow they discovered it and shouted at me to try and get me to take the post down!

I would like to add that searches when returning from ground/home leave are not thorough enough by far. I managed to conceal medication (to self-medicate and overdose on) on so many occasions, usually ending up with either paramedics on scene or me being admitted to general hospital. I even managed to conceal a very sharp item on me for the whole 6 months I was on this ward, which I used often to self-harm. I was simply not kept safe.

As stated above, I was on 1:1 observations for some of my inpatient stay. And I am disgusted to say, staff falling asleep on obs was a common occurrence. Or some staff brought phones and magazines into my bed space to pass the time, hence not concentrating on the patient they were meant to be supervising. Many times these magazines were then left in my bedspace, containing staples that I extracted to self-harm with. Therefore I do not feel I was kept safe 100% of the time.

Finally, I did not feel at all supported with my eating disorder. Because I was not underweight,  they simply did not care. Apart from on two occasions, they did not provide any meal support, and when I got upset (and ended up head-banging from feelings of guilt and being overwhelmed), I was told I had to ""take responsibility for my eating"" - well yes, I did take responsibility for my eating, but I could've done with some compassion when dealing with the distressing thoughts and feelings sirrounding food!",[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]

10797,"Sometimes decisions were made that I was not aware of (starting a new medication) or did not agree with, (unescorted leave), however, I had the opportunity to discuss these robustly in the MDT which I appreciated. 

Moving forwards, I think that the parents views should be sought about decisions and if there is a challenge to a decision, the parents views should be given more weight as they are the person that knows their child best.

There were several occasions where I was not informed James had ligature events, despite me asking to be informed. If parents do want to be informed please let them know in a timely manner. I wanted to know so that I could provide extra support to James at those times, but also to see if I could identify any patterns which might help on his return home.

I did occasionally feel I was judged if I could not answer a call straight away, particularly by the nursing team. As a full time working single mum with another teenager, you can imagine it was not because I was sitting doing nothing, in fact on several occasions it was because I was driving to or from Colchester which was a 2.5-3 hour journey each way. It may be useful for staff to reflect on this point as in my experience parents with children in this situation already feel judged by work colleagues, other family members, social services and friends. Having the same empathy that they have with the children to the parents would be good.

These criticisms are meant in a constructive manner. Overall I feel that we had the most positive experience possible in a very difficult and dark situation. Hopefully we will never need this support again, however, if James or my daughter were ever to need an inpatient mental health admission, I would be asking for a referral to Longview.

Especially my own nurse really made me feel very comfortable. She checked on me regularly. And ensured I had proper food on time. Really was very remarkable in her attitude. May God bless her.  The physio was absolutely great too, giving me extra time and attention to ensure I was safe and prepared. I had phone calls while she waited without creating any urgency.

11233,"Stephen Kent was excellent, very knowledgeable not just in his profession but in his understanding and empathy regarding mental health and the impact this has. 

I feel he possess a rare ability to read a situation not just extremely accurately but also present solutions and differing perspectives naturally and without causing offence.

Steve made me feel safe and secure during the whole process, he was always there when needed and provided extremely valuable insights not just for myself, but my line manager and my family through the Family Group Conferencing service.  His experience and demeanour was and is invaluable. Steve supported me early on in my recovery, helping me to navigate a difficult relationship with my line manager, and supported me during my occupational health assessment which I found very difficult, he was able to diffuse the situation and keep me on track, provide alternative solutions and his knowledge surrounding the process, my rights etc. empowered me to say no I have the right support around me, I am capable, he empowered me to look at access to work, and gently prompted me through encouragement of how it could help and that there is nothing wrong with needing help and taking the other support out there, that I wouldn't be a burden. 

I honestly do not have the words to really express how fundamental Steve has been in my recovery - from assisting in how to approach contact whilst being off long-term sick, not being able to communicate effectively myself, to supporting me in an awful experience of occupational health, to my gradual return to work, it being sustainable, and most recently my promotion - without Steve I may not have been not only back working in the position I was in before, but actually enjoying it again, and being seen as an asset despite my difficulties.

I have been supported by very professionals, both clinical and non-clinical, from EPUT since being admitted to hospital and following discharge and being treated in the community, and Stephen’s level of support and compassion has been amongst the best, if not the best. Furthermore, whilst my previous employment was unable to be retained due to circumstances beyond any of our control, Stephen continued to support me in providing follow-up advice and guidance around future employment as well as the option of introducing his services to my future employers. I have now successfully gained employment, and Stephen has continued to check in and provide me reassurance that I can still contact him and the employment services if I need any support or guidance in the future. 
I am incredibly grateful for the support provided, and Stephen even visited me in hospital for the initial appointment to gather a better understanding of my situation which helped put me at ease and have confidence in the service from the start.

This procedure is a common trick used in many hospitals to solve this problem and prevent potentially significant delays.

In my case no cylinders / bowls were available so the Phlebotomist had to use rubber gloves filled with hot water and knotted to prevent escape of any water - these were placed on my arm as makeshift 'heat pads' and produced the required effect to expose the veins for easier access to draw blood.

11276,"Subject: Medical Care Review and Concerns at Clevland Clinic London  To Whom It May Concern,  I am writing to provide feedback regarding the medical care and services we received at Clevland Clinic London following an accident that necessitated our transfer to your facility. While we found the accommodations to be of a satisfactory standard, there were notable deficiencies in the overall care provided during our stay, which raised significant concerns.  Firstly, the physical environment, including the room and facilities, was commendable, with a notable standard of cleanliness. However, the quality of care we received did not align with the expected standards of a renowned institution like Clevland Clinic.  Our primary concern revolved around the insufficient attention given to medical monitoring and care.  Throughout our stay, we observed a lack of consistency in essential medical procedures such as regular blood tests and vital sign monitoring. This inconsistency in care almost resulted in a life-threatening situation. There were instances when we urgently requested nursing assistance, only to experience prolonged response times. On some occasions, we waited for approximately 20 minutes with the call light unanswered, leading to frustration and uncertainty about the level of care we were receiving.  It appeared that there was an understaffing issue within the facility, which may have contributed to the delayed responses. Additionally, it seemed that the orthopedic ward received less emphasis on medical care, in comparison to a more intensive care setting. However, this lack of attention to detail had severe consequences. For instance, despite noticeable symptoms such as vomiting and severe diarrhea, the medical staff failed to conduct essential tests to assess blood levels, sodium levels, and electrolytes for an extended period, spanning  several days. This neglect extended to the failure to provide specific dietary and medial accommodations aligned with the patient's  needs.  Furthermore, the patient's vomiting persisted without any intervention, including necessary blood tests or adjustments to her medication regimen. Such lapses in care were unexpected from a healthcare facility affiliated with the esteemed reputation of the Cleveland Clinic. It appeared that there were no established protocols for routine blood testing, medication monitoring, or consistent care, creating an atmosphere where essential medical decisions were made on an ad hoc basis.  In contrast, healthcare facilities in the United States typically adhere to rigorous standards of daily blood testing, regardless of the patient's ward. Our admission for a fracture ultimately led to the emergence of medical issues we did not initially present with, which is deeply concerning.  In light of these observations, I kindly request a thorough review of the medical care provided during our stay at Clevland Clinic and the implementation of improved protocols to ensure consistent and appropriate care for all patients, irrespective of their ward. We believe that our experience should serve as an opportunity for enhancement within your institution to maintain the high standards you are known for.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. We anticipate your prompt response and actions addressing these concerns.  Sincerely,  [Your Name] [Patient or Family Member] [Contact Information]",[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]

The therapist was very helpful to direct me along two paths to help me find answers to my second subject of questions. I embraced both paths with some satisfaction. 

I want testing to discover where I might be, along the autism spectrum. I was directed to a website that I found very helpful. I was also directed to my GP, for consultation to establish whether I would be referred by them to a specialist to receive testing. I submitted my request to my GP’s office and, await a reply for an appointment with the GP. 

I understand the process and, I accept the current limits of Talking Therapy. I would like to see Talking Therapy empowered to activate a link, to connect a client like me, directly with a physician who would meet with me to determine whether a referral for autism testing is justified. 

Based on your current mandate, I only have thanks to give to the two therapists I encountered through Talking Therapy. The second of the two led me through a process of discovery for which I will always be grateful.

I am pleased with the way I was treated and all medical staff were exceptional in my view.
I would not a very minor issue on the My Chart phone verification system:
I personally prefer to receive email rather than text phone messages. The phone number verification appears to give just an originating phone number which is not instantly recognisable without a name to go with it, so I put the phone down not knowing if this is a scam form an unrecognised number. For me names are essential if I am to accept calls and even text messages.

Definitely the days where actual regular Rainbow staff is there have been much better, the professionalism and experience plays a big role.

The food has been a problem as our Autistic son with specific dietary requirements for crisp has been served soak meals as far as we noted, we provide many snacks and get fast food on our visits to support food intake.

On positive, everyone involved in EMDT is amazing, Rainbow/Brooklands staff and professionals are vey supportive and knowledgeable, the school teacher is just perfect, the only downsize is use if support agency and technical building difficulties, this although very robust, our son still found some parts to destroy ( some plasterboard, sockets, paper holder etc).

11611,"The appointment was beneficial and I believe that when training days are held, the Trust should consider deaf awareness training, as there are very few medical staff, whatever their position/status/grade level that fully understand what issues deaf people have. It seems to me that training days do not focus on assistance issues, so you are in essence letting all deaf/hearing impaired patients down for just a few simple changes that would benefit a lot if patients. There are so many younger patients who nowadays are also struggling and would benefit from the staff doing deaf awareness courses. . 

Therefore, there was nothing else the lady could have done because they are well tuned into their patients needs, difficulties and issues they have depending upon the level of hearing loss but also the types of issues or difficulty the patient has with the tinnitus sounds and levels of sounds plus vary degrees of sounds as well as when the patient has different sounds in different ears, like music in one ear and say crashing waves in the other at the same time whilst they are trying to distinguish what the speaker is sying. It is very stressful for the patients and the visit to audiology helped me to understand more about how to cope with these ordeals 

The audiologists had the necessary knowledge, skills and understanding to do the appointment to the extent that I had no issues. 

You ask about anything you could have done better. The audiology department is well above the other departments as they fully understand the patients needs in all areas.

However, the Trust is lacking in its knowledge and understanding of the needs of the patients which then let's the audiology department down. 

Being deaf is not easy, it's extremely difficult to understand what people are saying, if they are too far away, mumbling, moving around, changing to different levels or tones of speaking from what you understand but suddenly dropping to a lower tone and level that you lose it and struggle to hear what's being said. 

This issue should be given priority in terms of importance, many patients go through their time in the hospital having not fully understood what's been said but worse, much worse. Staff end up believing that they have to raise their voices to get the patient to understand, the patient's lose their dignity and privacy as everyone hears what the doctors/staff are saying. This can be extremely embarrassing, not only for the patient but also others who have no choice but to hear. I'm fortunate that I can switch the hearing aids off, so am saved having these issues, however, others are less fortunate.

Does the front reception have access to 'My Chart'? My previous visit I paid £160 but I received a credit of £40. My next visit (just a week later) I was charged £160 again. When I queried this, they said ""this is the price"". I asked why I had received a credit then but they couldn't see the credit (but it is on my account in My Chart'!!) I also mentioned that I was insured for this course of treatment and I had updated 'My Chart' with my insurance details - but again they couldn't see it. So I ended up paying £160 again!! NOWHERE have I been told what the charges are. I have received NO INVOICES for my treatment only Statements or Receipts, which are after the event!! The front desk at Cleveland Clinic in Portland Place are not very good (I over heard a patient at the desk on the 3rd floor that they didn't want to go to the main Reception because they were useless!)

I also get too many emails and texts from My Chart.

11767,"The communication regarding the Portal wasn't great.  It looked very comprehensive but its quite hard to navigate.  Lots of the sections aren't populated  eg the billing info.  I had to contact the hospital to understand whether an appointment showing in the portal was a phone or an in person meeting - there was no way of knowing which it was. The medical test results from Friday were updated into the portal swiftly but they are pretty meaningless to anyone with limited medical knowledge, particularly where the results are out of the 'normal' range.  It would be useful to have either someone call with the results or have someone add personalised notes to the results section eg '' the alkaline levels are high because you take a statin each day, so this 'high' result is not something to worry about.''
I don't think the Nurse who called my mother for the pre op discussion was initially provided with the correct phone number.  I'm not sure why. The portal contact number was correct.  So Mum waited 20mins for the phone call.
The Nurse who called was very kind and gentle in her tone but unfortunately she provided misinformation regarding the operation that Mum was having.  She mistook the op for full open heart surgery which is something my Mum is very clear she would never agree to  - Mum was confused and distressed at hearing, for example, that her recovery period for the bones to knit back together was 3months (this is not applicable for her op so was never something that should have been mentioned, in my mind)- so as a nervous patient this really did nothing to alleviate her worries.
The Nurse's accent was also quite strong which combined with being on a mobile phone meant mum struggled to understand some of the Nurse's points.  In retrospect, I should have asked to be on the call too - this was my error.
In relation to making the payment for the operation, I struggled to find the reference numbers required in the admission payment information.  I emailed Eric in Reservations about this and he swiftly replied and confirmed the relevant reference - but he also confirmed that this was not information that I would have access to, had I not asked.  So that admin point needs to be corrected. 
With regard to the package cost, this was one figure initially via the medical secretary, she then explained it had been revised to another figure which I accepted and then when the payment information was emailed from Eric in Reservations, the figure had reverted again.  This was confusing to me and I had to call to confirm what operation and what price was definitely correct.  
Thus far the process as a whole doesn't feel as 'slick' as I think it should.

I then had to get a code for the procedure from the call centre but when i rang back no one could help with that and told me to speak to radiology on another number and could not put me through. I find this a strange way to deal with a customer. When I did get through to radiology the lady I spoke with then wanted to pass me to someone else as she was busy seeing patients to register them. I refused to be passed around to someone else and the lady eventually dealt with my call although was still unable to give the correct code which eventually I had to get from the Consultants PA.

Everyone is very nice at the clinic but my observations are there are lots of folk at the centre in terms of Admin but they do not seem to have a clue.  Consultant care from the person I was seeing to the Radiologist and his assistants is excellent but the Admin is letting the side down.  A big dollop of customer care training is required in my view.  These people are the first people you see and hear from as a patient so they are your shop window and you need to get this right.

11842,"The discharge process was a bit of a let down. I arrived to pick my father up at 9.00a.m. because I was worried about parking and traffic given you are so close to Buckingham Palace, and the queen had died, so there was a lot of road restrictions and road closures. we were keen to get away early but mainly due to your pharmacy being extremely slow, we didn't get away until about 13.00. We had to wait for ages, and even when the nurses phoned and the dr (Fellow) phoned, they were still excruciatingly slow. And all this to give us ......paracetamol...and some dihydrocodeine. The pharmacist apologised for the delay, but although aware we were waiting, had not as far as I'm aware, made much of an effort to speed things up. So this could be improved. 

I don't think my father used the call bell very much, but we did hear some call bells going off for quite a while which might imply that some patients are waiting  a while for their call to be answered. 

I do feel security at the front desk could be a little bit more robust. Sometimes I was asked who I was going to visit and which room they were in (which is good, they are checking who I am) but sometimes I wasn't and they just printed off my name badge.  

My dad did have trouble sleeping due to noise, I don't think it was excessively noisy but he could hear a radio, and his aircon system gave a buzz.

The Sky TV is ok but not brilliant. The TV screen quality isn't great. (not a major issue).

A general observation that your female nurses seem much more friendly than the male nurses. This is in no way meant to be a sexist comment literally just something my father observed on a day to day basis. We did have a lovely admissions nurse, (male) Joron Jimenez, he was very engaging and funny which helped relax my dad who was extremely anxious. 

I had one interaction with someone from your self pay team who was quite abrupt/off but she could just have been having a bad day? Again just a one off observation but since you are asking for feedback...

However marlon and Lara I felt gave me information and I felt like they understood my frustration and tried to help. The matron Rachel should be sacked! And I was lied to by the social worker who emailed saying an assessment will be done at his Nans house before he is released and IT WASN’T. I had called social services about his Nan.

The issue has been communication between different units and staff and differences in messages being related to me. Anything that did get communicated to me was only as a result of me asking the same questions over and over instead of it being shared openly as available 

My biggest problem has been that I have been here due to pain. The pain was relived as soon as I got here so lessons had been learned for what it would take. April the pain consultant I absolutely highly recommend - her patience and time spent with me was outstanding and made me very confident to deal with the pain going forward. However …. The agreed pain plan outlined was not being used during my stay and the directions of it were not clear. The only way I could get pain relief from being here was to experience pain and ask for extra relief, rather than using the experience to prevent the pain from happening again so badly.

I was here for pain relief, and a plan got together, it should not take for me to be discharged for the pain plan to have to be in use. 

Communication between consultants, doctors and nurses has been inconsistent. I do not want to delay on this given everyone individually has been so nice as caring people. There should just be an appropriate timeline in place and as information becomes available it should be shared with a patient without patient needing to ask about it repeatedly.

Many nurses went beyond the call of duty to ensure that I was comfortable and felt at home as much as possible. The housekeeping team also were extremely warm as they went about their duties.

The kitchen service may be the only area which can be improved immediately. I think menus could be more diverse for international patients and also think the staff (which I assumed are relatively new to the institution) can be more prepared when delivering meals since they sometimes forget the appropriate cutlery or other essentials for the consumption of the meals.

Your physiotherapy team was outstanding ambassadors of the Clinic. Tamara and Darnley in particular were exemplary. Tamara showed great compassion to me throughout the process. Sean also developed a healthy rapport with me always reassuring me of my progress based on having a bilateral hip replacement surgery.

I kept music within my bedroom (431) and many members of staff thought this was refreshing. Perhaps the clinic could consider especially when conducting physiotherapy session inserting background music since music helps us to tolerate and relax more when we are facing uphill exercises after a major surgery. Just a suggestion.

I also think a few plants on the floor of the wards could also help to bring a less sterile feel to the clinic which is predominantly painted in white. Some vibrant accent walls could be useful.",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

With female only doing yhe ecg. Nothing i seemed to say to the team scared them away. They were so sympthetic towards me when i was still under them and my nan passed away. Always explaining before i end a visit with them that i can always ring them 8am till 8pm someone will be there to talk to me. This was very reassuring as i was and still am under aloy of stress but it relived it knowing there was going to be someone at the other ebd of the phone during those times to keep me going and to chat too. I also confinded in the mid essex home treatment team about a crime and was treated once again with respect and safeguarding matters were raised immediately and dealt with. I was encouraged and helped to report it to the police and they have been there every step of the way. Some people dont like the different people each day. But thats how the team works you cant just get asigned to one person to be there for you 7 days a week for 12 hours you wouldnt have that in hospital nor in any other community teams. They know all about your individual case any way so its not like a stranger walking into you care they know why you under them and whats been your progress or set backs etc. They try and keep the same few people seeing you but its shift work so it can be a bit difficult i guess. But overall i have found that each and everyone of the team is amazing. They are honest , kind, caring, compassionte and i feel like they are the only team willing to go that extra mile to keep you in the commuity where manageable.

Not only is it frustrating but could be very dangerous for some patients on vital medication.
My second issue was with the ordering of food.  Patients should be given a menu to digest and choose rather than read off an Ipad by the person taking the order who also wants an instant answer.

12246,"The nurses were amazing & my main consultant is fabulous but there are a few areas that I think could be improved. When I started bleeding post-op, I didn’t feel the team listened properly to how bad it was & so were very slow to respond. I feel I lost a lot of blood before the blood tests were done & then it felt a bit like panic mode (15 doctors & nurses in my room whilst they got the transfusions sorted). Everyone was absolutely lovely & caring but I think it could have been managed quicker. It also took a while to explain the management plan to me (stopping the bleeding vs protecting the bowel anastomosis) which helped a lot once explained. There is not great communication between the medical team & the catering team for a colorectal ward given how important diet is. The choices also felt very limited for post-bowel surgery until I was told I could essentially order what I wanted (but not until it been trying to transition off nil by mouth & clear fluids for a few days I.e. this should be clear up front). Finally, it would be SO helpful to be able to open a window!! I know it sounds minor but I’ve been in the hospital 3 times now & have always had issues with the room being too hot or too cold. I understand it’s hard to have fully opening windows but being able to open them partly to have some fresh air would make a huge difference. I suffer from migraines & headaches which were awful after the blood transfusions & I do think they would have improved much faster with fresh air.",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.]

12287,"The one thing I'm not so happy about is not the fault of Holly Wheelchair service or any of the staff that so excellently and competently provide it, but rather the lack of appropriate options & provision for severely disabled and mobility impaired people. I have extremely impaired mobility and can awkwardly move less than 5ft on a very good day and perhaps 2-3ft on an average day or 0ft having to crawl along the floor like a slug on a bad health day and struggle more and more to rise from my chair, using two walking sticks and have lost everything to my deteriorating health, except my life which will surely follow at some point in the near future. A decade of constant prescribing of Antibiotics due to a severe immune/dermatological condition (only relatively recently diagnosed) alongside endocrine and hormonal disorders and other conditions have damaged my nerves, wasted my muscles by being bed bound with infection, damaged my spine and caused reactive arthritis which inflames and stiffens joints all over my body during infections (which are constant and recurring). I have heart disease causing very low blood pressure which is untreatable and means my balance is very poor and I fall regularly. I also have had asthma from childhood which makes it hard to breath. Add dizziness, to balance, to pain, to breathlessness, to muscle wasting, to fatigue, to wasted muscle and flared up nerves together and what do you get? Someone who has had to crawl around the floor at times and has embarrassingly on occasion messed themselves when no one is available to help me and I can't make it to the toilet quickly enough...… and yet I still apparently don't ""quite"" meet the ""requirements"" or ""rules"" for an electric wheelchair to be prescribed, despite my original GP referral (made many years ago now) indicating that one was necessary, even back then before I reached this low of health and despite efforts from my social worker to help me as well. It almost feels like it's a punishment to keep pushing myself and to make the efforts even when it's like wading through a concrete morass of pain or that you are penalised for being honest about my extremely limited mobility and makes you think, just give up at times. Disabled and chronically unwell people (for the most part) want to and WILL help themselves! Wherever possible, we are all used to struggle to our own varying degrees, but we need to be given the tools to help us do so and conversely outdated thinking, cynicism and incredibly myopic decision making in terms of guidelines are counter productive to that end in my own personal opinion and in the opinion of many people in the disabled and chronically unwell diaspora. I can't tell you how depressing and dispiriting it is to lose your personal agency to help yourself even when you want to. I've been hospitalised for infections requiring surgical intervention at Addenbrookes hospital in Cambridge under the care of multiple specialty's 2 times so far in 2023 and during every single stay the hardest part has not been the illness or confusion or pain or malaise or worry about outcomes, death and the future, but rather it's been feeling trapped and not being able to help myself. Relying on over worked and short staffed nurses and HCA's to help me wash and mobilise despite the fact that each ward I've been on has completely adapted shower and bathroom facilities mere feet away is a deliciously crisp and saccharine apple of irony, given that I can't properly use them if I can't get to them and despite the fact that it's extremely unhealthy for the disabled to have rely on other people in this way unless we absolutely have to. Many in the disabled community I know through family, friendships or support groups feel attacked by cynical politicians, the poverty endemic amongst the long term chronically sick and a failure for wider society to help or think of others and yet even if you want to help yourself you can't. You're stuck with an attendant controlled wheelchair in a world of social and health care with an extreme shortage of attendants. I can't even leave the ward to buy a coffee or a newspaper or take a mental health break from the poor suffering people and the never ending beeping machines, chirping away incessantly and presaging my own inevitable demise. This extreme paucity of electric wheelchair precision is counter productive in so many different and offensive ways. I have fainted from low blood pressure, screamed in pain or lost balance completely multiple times trying to mobilise impossible (for me) distances whilst hospitalised and at home on crutches, frames or sticks and have had to have been (humiliatingly) scraped of the floor like a dropped pancake by overwhelmed staff on each and every occasion occasion. No one deserves to end up with a pulled over bookcase on there head, the books are supposed to enter the head via reading not assimilation through blunt force. During the periods in between hospitalisation I am suffering repeat infections and trying desperately to avoid hospital, my groin and backside is covered in abscesses and inflammatory nodules where my immune system attacks me over and over again that can make standing or sitting agonising and the complete loss of agency and independence I suffer, in not being able to access my community or my human rights is an affront to my dignity and I am surely far from the worst affected patient due to these policy's. I have to use a Bi-Level ventilator with Oxygen during sleep to maintain my airway when unconscious and am now suffering from severe antibiotic resistance. During my last admission doctors made it clear to me that the main condition from which I suffer has no cures and I have failed on every available pharmacological treatment which no longer work for me and that this was threatening my life and spelled out my future (or lack) of future clearly and yet be musingly, I still don't quite qualify for an electric chair which I can control myself. Perhaps I should stop my carers from washing or shaving me and start lying on forms instead of the floor to get the right equipment to live better with? Cynicism begats cynical behaviour after all. Who knows maybe if lose my dignity and stop presenting as well as I possibly can I will regain some dignity by being able to go to a shop or go out for fresh air ALONE for once. What a Faustian mess. I wonder who at a CCG or the new partially privatised American style ICBs or whatever panel of disconnected and politicised physicians involved, (who are usually entirely disassociated from the consequences of said decisions) make these inappropriate and severe rationing guidelines for basic equipment needed for the fundamental human right not to be trapped or the right to a family or personal life when your disability prevents you from having one due to a basic piece of equipment being missing when clearly and reasonably needed. How much money does it actually save our funding starved, inflation hit NHS when patients, who denied this provision of self controlled mobility and personal agency, fall and break brittle bones, lose the mental will to keep fighting, suffer bed or sofa sores due to being unable to move around or have heart attacks and strokes trying to do the near impossible? How much does surgery, intensive care and rehabilitation cost for a chronically unwell person with comorbidities who's broken a hip or suffered a premature MI or stroke? Quite a bit more by the tens of thousands than a basic piece of equipment that's been more widely available since the 1950s which most second world countries are somehow able to provide. To qualify this and to be constructive and fair, just as we cannot blame the excellent clinicians, engineers and staff of the wheelchair services for these guidelines (who whilst too professional to express it are (I would imagine) at times frustrated themselves by them, also we cannot (completely) blame the wider NHS as none of us have control over political funding decisions (other than our votes). However to scrimp and try to save in one area such as electric wheelchair provisions not only comes at a cost of personal dignity, agency and worsening outcomes but the cost of the repercussions of these decisions in the long term. It's short sighted and a great shame. Please give the Wheelchair services FULL not opaque or borderline decision making ability in terms of what they provide. They ARE EXPERTS in their fields and know what is needed, who needs it and that total paralysis should not be the only qualifier for the ability to control your own life and movement, they are more than capable of assessing who has genuine needs. More personally speaking I am still extremely hopeful that the Holly Wheelchair service will be able to work with me and my caregivers by requesting any further necessary medical evidence or agency they may require, in order to help me access an electric chair and take back control of my own life at some point in the near future and that those making decisions should be those at the coalface and not the site office in future. If you read this and share my frustration or parts of them then Thank You for your decency and public service and I hope you are well. If you read this part as a decision maker or policy mandarin, then do better.

I was then told to scan it and forward it, in an email.  I don't have a scanner at home, so I took a picture of the referral form and attached that to the email.  I then got a reply saying they could not accept my referral in this way - it had to be scanned.  I replied that I do not have a scanner - and was then told it was fine and my referral had been received.  I am fairly computer literate - I'm not sure an older person or someone not used to technology would have worked their way through this system. 

I was then offered a two hour group exercise course - on my phone.  I explained I work in a school with very limited signal - I would not be able to spend two hours, on my phone, trying to engage in a group exercise class.  Plus, up till then, no one had explained what was wrong with my knee and I did not feel comfortable discussing this in front of strangers over the phone. Reluctantly I was given the face to face appointment.

I am very grateful for those, and the physiotherapist I saw was lovely and very helpful.  I just feel the process of getting there was overly complicated and someone less determined or capable would have given up.

12490,"The room both for this appointent and at normal appointments in dellword is over crowded, has no walls agains which one can easily and naturally do/ demonstrate an exercise - one has to gently mimic things as there is no wall to press against. Physios, need to make a space into a practise area.  (However if one want to check or demonstrate soething to a patient it is not impossible). 

The physio should observe and assess the exercises at the start and have a base line and then should re assess after a period of practise so we are abith aware of the changes - not just one of use and she can she where improvement has been made and more could or not be expected.

The physio needed to assess why my arm was sore at visit 2 before doing manipulation rather than jumping into it.  I had talked of a heavy arm in visit 1, but she said she hadn't noticed the problem in visit 1. However we never discussed further either in visit 1 or visit 2 before doing the manipuation. 

The physio needs training in the use of participative practices - she asks questions which I answer. If she had drawn a time line with me ( as I did on returning home) and noted events and dates we could have identified the issue together on visit 2 , no analysis of the sore arm/ shoulder/ kneck was done till it got worse resulting in visit 3. Even then she did a time line - on her computer for herself, she did not share it or check it with me, and  either key questions were ommitted or key understanding that she would not have had access to was left unidentifed. If she had made it more participative and drawn line on paper and noted dates and activities I could have told her that I had hardly used my arms for 3 weeks and on return took up routine exercise and  the new physio exercises and unplanned manipulation . 

The physio: 
- needs training in simple participative techniques e.g time line and probably other similar such things 
- needs simple tools like paper and pen, or pain chart high = low  etc to use in a participative exporation of patient issue, 
-she needs training and practice in how to evidence her opinions by providing proof  through observation and measures, and detailed questions  rather than relying on subjective chat and talk, and her idea of what is wrong all be it based on long experience.
- she needs to be less hasty and  to ask more questions before forming her judgements e.g. she needs to ask more details on the yoga or bike set up,  or  observe the person on the bike before deciding to advise us on new expensive, inconvenient and inappropriate ways to change our lives and activities

I have been given an appointment with a physio which is 26th June.  I had explained to Shiela my current physio, that  I would be away for 2 months from 1st July.   I would have hoped this would have been passed on and asn appointment made for neared to my previously booked appointment of the 6th June.  I understand the NHS is tight on resources and everyone is busy - however, an appointment on 26th June is a waste of everyones time and NHS resources.

The hospital should be closed down as a danger to the public.

We were not given any pre-op guidance re when to stop eating etc until I insisted the day before. The written paperwork was delivered to the room the day AFTER the operation. I had to get on to the head office in Ohio to get things moving. 

Food was delivered very slowly and late. Initially the patient (with a brain tumour) was told that she had to order food by an iPad which she was totally unfamiliar with and incapable of using because of her condition. 
After the major surgery, no one bothered telling the patient what was supposed to happen next - even tho the surgery was only the first step in the treatment of a brain tumour. 
On the day of discharge the nurse tried to give the patient some important heart medication twice over! Luckily the confused patient called her husband who immediately rushed over and prevented the overdose happening. 
Proper communication with the patient was dreadful to non-existent. The MyChart system is a joke. It says there are messages for the patient when there isn’t anything new.

12811,"The surgeons, anaesthetist, nurse who removed vaginal pack, and Kirsty calling after my discharge were excellent.   There was also a lovely, helpful nurse on Friday night , 4 November in a green uniform . 

It started with the nurses not knowing when I should put the compression socks on , before or after surgery, and ended when being discharged with a nurse not knowing how long I needed to keep them on for at home.  They always seemed to need to check with someone else.

Sorry to say that the nursing staff were either too young and/or inexperienced.  There didn’t seem to be enough nurses either.  I was told that a patient was very ill and at the end of my stay the nurse said she was sorry for not attending to me as she should have.  

I vomited on the Friday night and was told it may have been due to something I ate and that a special diet hadn’t  been requested .  There was also confusion about pain relief.  One nurse said I could have a morphine tablet if in a lot of pain and then when I asked for that because my pain was 7/8 out of 10, I was told by another nurse that wasn’t correct and that Tramidol would be better.  They seemed to be annoyed .

Nurses seemed preoccupied with the computer systems and entering information as opposed to talking with the patient. 

I wasn’t informed that it could take between 6 to 8 hours until I could urinate after the catheter was removed.  And then told I hadn’t been moving around the ward , which maybe contributed to my not being able to urinate adequately.  A nurse wrote “movement” on the white board but didn’t come to let me know when.  It want until the end of my stay that Simone said I should walk out on the ward.

The catering was diabolical! It took 3 and half hours to get my lunch and that was only because someone came to take the dinner order.  A nurse asked the kitchen 3 times during that 3 and half hours and I was then told it was delivered but I was on the toilet! 

I mentioned to a nurse called Elizabeth that I was feeling stressed after all this , plus the fact I needed to now go home rather than stay a second night.  Shereplied along lines of , “ you do get anxiety , just breathe”.  Really not acceptable. 

I had to ask to see a physiotherapist but by that time they weren’t available and I haven’t received a call to date.",[0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.]

I arrived at 10 as per instructions, then told my surgery wasn't scheduled until 5pm (so in actual fact I could have eaten breakfast at least). Then the surgery was delayed, then I was told I might need to stay overnight (I had no overnight bag), so they told me to phone BUPA to check that I was covered for an overnight stay (about 30 minutes before the surgery).",[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

The nurses in recovery were also fantastic assisting me with a wheelchair trip to the toilet and trying to call my partner. They helped to put me at ease when I was very anxious following the operation.  Unfortunately the nursing team in the wards were incompetent at times and flustered as though they didn’t know what to do. This was everything from my admission assessment to aftercare. I was given different information about pain relief by different nurses. Staff change overs clearly had no communication on my care or needs. The only exception to this was the nurse who cared for me through the night, regularly checking on me and providing pain medication. My partner was given no information as to an update on my surgery or what was happening even though he repeatedly asked. He was not told I was going to a different room on a different floor after surgery and was left worried that something had gone wrong as he couldn’t get any information. I was told I would be given extra pain relief to take home on top of my regular medication and waited 3 hours for this only to be told I wouldn’t be given anything. I could have discharged at 9am instead of 12. I should have been given my naproxen at 8am before discharging but the nurse couldn’t get it from the pharmacy until 11:30. I took my own pain medication in the end as I was also still waiting for more pain relief and in agony by this point.  The food service was a complete disaster. My partner requested tea twice whilst waiting for me in my room, this never arrived even though he was told it would be brought to him.  The food ordered for dinner was not what arrived. We received pasta sauce instead of gravy also,  this was not corrected even though I asked. I therefore had no dinner following my surgery. Breakfast arrived 40 minutes late. Only one of the 2 drinks ordered arrived and half the food missing. We also had no cuttlery suitable for eating with. This was corrected within 25 minutes but the food was cold by this point. Again I didn’t eat breakfast following my surgery before discharge.  I did not feel that I was cared for at all in the 2 ward rooms. I left the hospital after vomiting repeatedly the morning after my surgery yet no nurse asked how I was before I was told I was being discharged.

For them get go I felt like I was part of a team, that we was working on my issues together. As opposed to just being a name on a list/tock box exercise. Like I've felt many places befor.
The staff are friendly, energetic and caring. The environment there is always encouraging and hopeful.  The team works together, with you, to help achieve your goals. No judgement, ego, patriarchy, or aggression. Just care, hope and support. 

They have also had access to some brilliant medical services, like the psychiatrist being part of the team, and in house. That was super, super helpful. 
The nurses sent just give you a once over and throw a blue script at you, they treat each appointment as if it was a stand alone thing.
You are seen and treated by professionals, and you feel that emidiatly. 
The support worker is contact able as much as one could expect them too be. If they aren't available someone else will talk with you if possible.  If ever you try calling out of hours, the message box is never full and you get contacted back protty sharpish 
The counselling team are somewhat close to the team there, so when I had a situation after counselling my support worker was notified and I received a heap of support when she reached out.

I really cant stress enough just how brilliant the team at open road chelmsford is. Not only have they stuck by me and helped me get on track, but everything about the service looks and feels soo much better than other places I've been and tried.

I have been racking my brains since being discharged of the right words to say as thank you and appreciation just do not sum up the care I received. For the first time in my life, I felt seen and heard. I was made to feel like a person. 

Jade, you are a hero. My hero. You told me that recovery was possible and to be quite honest you saved my life! I had given up with hoping tomorrow was going to be a better day, I got to a point where hope was not enough anymore, then you mentioned recovery and that gave me more than hope ever has. I am so thankful to you. You are an absolute credit to your team and to the nursing profession - if more nurses were like you the world would be a better place. You went above and beyond for me and thank you just is not a big enough word to express how you have impacted me. You made sure everything was in place before I came home making it a seamless transition and allowing me to get better in my own home. 

Dr Aendany, thank you for coming in on your day off to see me, thank you for listening to me, and seeing me, and making me feel like an actual person not just a mental health diagnosis. Thank you for being so thorough. Thank you for making me feel normal. You made sure everything was in place to get me home and for that I'm truly thankful.

13289,"This comment is not about the latest great visit.

Historically, I had some issues with the district nurse service, with one particular nurse. 

After a fall resulting in serious injuries, A&E referred to district nurse to dress both legs and arms regularly.  I was not mobile.  I have a downstairs hospital bed. Before the wounds were fully healed, I had to be taken to eye hospital, which was not easy. Because my records showed I had been to a hospital appointment, one of the nurses said that meant I was 'up and about', and stopped visits to dress my wounds.  

My oncologist and haematoligist said that the nurses should have kept coming until dressings were no longer needed. I am extremely vulnerable to infections due to blood cancer, and rituximab treatment, and shielded, and had little mobility   I should have continued to have dressings from nurse at home. Instead, my daughter did them at home, but is not a nurse and would not necessarily know if there was anything wrong.

Similarly, during lockdown, when I was on high dose steroids and with low platelets, I had terrible skin tears.  I am extremely vulnerable to infections.  That same nurse again stopped visits to dress wounds, saying my daughter could do them.  This was unsupportive and stressful.",[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

13313,"This previous lack of communication and documentation of the service meant when I was verbally informed of a consolidation period of therapy, around Easter time. I was told I should contact the service again in September. When I made contact with the service just prior to September, I was informed I was meant to make contact a couple of months earlier and the file had been closed. The file was reopened and I was provided with an appointment in a couple of months. However this impacted my childs care significantly, it meant a prolonged period without therapy and a wait to get an appointment. This resulted in 6 months without treatment, which is a long time for a 2-3 year olds development. 

I don't believe its in a childs interest to rely on a concerned parent to initiate further therapy. A parent may not fully appreciate its importance or may not have the capacity to engage or be fully involved in the best interests of their child. I think its the service who should ensure continuity of care. Possibly providing a follow up appointment following a consolidation period prior to 'closing' a file, effectively discharging a child who needs further treatment. 

Its clear the service requires additional funding to meet the current demand, especially after COVID pandemic. The first 2 years of my childs life was isolated at home with a mother who had postnatal depression. Im not the only parent and child who was significantly impacted by the pandemic. That's why services such as SALT should be funded adequately. The impact of speech and language difficulty in early years clearly shows a life long negative association.

13314,"This review is specifically in response to the renal ultrasound I had at Cleveland, Grosvenor Place on 31st May 2023; this review does not in any way reflect any other care I have received, which has been caring and compassionate.

Owing to symptoms of constant nausea and intermittent vomiting for nine months, plus dull pain in lower left back and left stomach, prior to attending Cleveland, London, I had in February and March 2023 a number of investigative procedures, namely on 10th February a Bravo Endoscopy; on 22nd February an Oesophagael Manomentry; on 17th March a Chest CT and on 20th March an Upright Barium Swallow.

I had my first consultant led appointment at Cleveland, London on 5th April, followed by on 19th April an Ultrasound Doppler Aorta (including duplex); on 24th May an MRI abdomen MRCP; on 31st May a Renal Ultrasound and finally on 1st June a Nuclear Medicine Solid Gastric Emptying Study.

My Renal Ultrasound appointment on 31st May was at 08.20hrs and I was asked to arrive at 08.05hrs to prepare me for the scan. As requested, I had drunk one litre of still water at 07.15hrs, i.e. one hour before the scan time.

I arrived at the reception area just before 08.00hrs but it was not until 08.25 that a young male nurse, who was pleasant but looked a little flustered, came to take me to the scanning room at which time I was beginning to feel a little uncomfortable following the amount of water I had taken.

I have had a number of previous renal scans taking a good half hour or more, so knew what to expect, but this scan was nothing like previous scans, as it was perfunctory! The nurse prepared me for the scan, i.e. exposing my stomach and I gave the nurse a report of my previous scan, itemising a number of renal cysts and an angiolipoma from a year earlier, as I thought this might be useful..Just after 08.30 a young male dressed in scrubs entered the scanning room; I assumed he was the doctor/radiologist to do the scan. I looked at him and said hello, good morning. As  he scowled at me and did not reply I thought he had obviously got out of bed the wrong side or someone had upset him - by now the nurse was visably trembling.

The 'Medic' went to the scanning machine and lifted a probe; he then said ""I am a consultant and my name is Dr. Tam"". He did not look at me, in fact he did not look me in the eyes once during the exceedingly short scan.He looked at the report, I had brought with me, for about ten seconds; he was obviously not interested in my previous report, nor was he interested in me. The scanning procedure was over in less than ten minutes at end of which he said ""there's nothing here"" and walked away from me. I called him back as I felt hurt that he had not bothered to speak to me for a few minutes. I asked him what he thought my problem may be. He responded by saying ""I have no idea, it may be your stomach or something else"". He walked away from me again and I called him back again by asking, as I had had issues with kidney cysts for a number of years, ""should I have any monitoring?"". He shrugged his shoulders and said ""That's entirely up to you""; he left the room; he simply didn't care. I regard the cost (£714.00) of this procedure of a  less than ten minute scan with no medical dialogue, as obscene. By now the nurse looked so embarrassed, I thought he was going to burst into tears.

13334,"This was my second operation at this hospital. My first experience was outstanding but this visit wasn't as good.

On arrival there was a new/inexperienced HCA or nurse. He seemed unsure and wasn't able to find the right words to describe a cuff to take blood pressure. Later the nurse informed me that he was a new member of bank staff. I was very relieved when this bank staff member finished their shift as I didn't feel confident in their abilities to check my vitals.

Later in the day after my surgery, I asked a nurse/HCA (unsure which) if I could have an anti-emetic as I felt nauseous, this member of staff was confused by my request and didn't know what an anti-emetic was. I found this worrying as I'd expect staff working with patients out of surgery to know what an anti-emetic is since nausea is common following surgery.

The overnight nurse however was fantastic and I felt I was in safe hands with her. She was also bank staff but very experienced.

The next day, I was asked by a nurse what time I'd like discharge and I said mid-afternoon. I was then asked by another nurse who informed me that discharge should be at 11am.

From 1200 onwards, I had to repeatedly use the call button to either request meds, drinks and for updates on my discharge and was eventually discharged at 7pm. I was told that I needed to be seen by both pharmacy and a doctor. In the end I didn't see a doctor and was given my discharge papers by a nurse and handed by medications by pharmacy. Due to insistence on staff that I would be discharged soon, I had not ordered dinner and so left the hospital extremely tired and without a meal arriving home at 10pm.

13338,"This was one of the most poorly organised examples of private health care I have experienced. Here is the schedule:
1. Fri 21 Oct - My cardiologist's assistant tells me she has booked a CT Cardio Angiogram at Cleveland Clinic for the coming Mon 24 Oct, and that the clinic would be calling me to arrange the exact time. No one from the clinic calls.
2. Mon 24 Oct - Around 10am, I call my cardiologist to confirm that no one from Cleveland has been in touch. They chase Cleveland clinic, and a lady called ""Katie"" eventually calls me. We agree a time, but she tells me that because I have had a cup of tea that morning (unsurprising since I have been given zero notice or instructions about the procedure), she will need to confirm that it is still ok. Katie never calls back. She also doesn't tell me the address where the procedure will take place, nor does she bother sending me an email to confirm. She has also not provided me with a return phone number, so I again have to ask my cardiologist's assistant to chase. Eventually, someone (not Katie) calls from Cleveland to tell me that the procedure will be at Portland Place. He seems utterly confused when I ask him why I havent received a confirmation email, but eventually he sends one to me.
3. Mon 24 Oct - I arrive at Cleveland Clinic, and at check in, am cheerily greeted by the aforementioned Katie who says she was the one who spoke to me earlier. She still has absolutely no sense of awareness of the fact that she provided me with no information at all about my appointment, and has no sense of shame about her inadequate performance.
4. Mon 24 Oct - The quality of care I receive is slapdash, amateurish and verging on the insulting. The radiologist and assistant who performed my angiogram seemed to be doing this for the first time. They were uncertain, unhelpful, and left me in physically uncomfortable positions for extended periods of time. On completion, there was zero after care - the radiologist was extremely unhelpful with where I should go next. Bearing in mind what I had just been through, I should have some assistance. There was absolutely none. There was no one to show me back to the changing room, and when I found it, there were used gowns strewn on the chairs in the room. I complained at reception, but I doubt very much that any action was taken, so I am writing this all down now.",[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0.]

I was given conflicting information by the Admissions team when trying to rebook my procedure. Initially I was told that I would only have to wait 2 weeks before I could have surgery. So I asked to be added to Ms Murphy's list on Thursday August 18. 

I was then told that in fact the hospital is following national guidance issued by the Royal Colleges that there should be a 7 week delay between a positive test result and surgery. Even though I was asymptomatic, had isolated for 5 days, and tested negative for a further week.

Fortunately Ms Murphy and Dr Appleby overruled this guidance and the surgery went ahead as planned.

I would suggest that your staff should be briefed on the current situation regarding Covid-19 guidelines at the hospital.

I had to chase and was completely ignored, no response from her. I then called the contact centre, I was told there are daily complaints from patients about this woman… it took for a very helpful lady to ask Alison what was going on… the GP details were then added to my profile…. That was 5 weeks later. I should have started the medication around the time of my consultation 5 weeks previous. For all this woman knew I could be extremely ill and needed that medication quickly.

The physio was very good, as was Anders the neurosurgeon's specialist nurse. It is comforting to have his details so if we have any issues we can contact him. He spoke to us for a long time and gave us a lot of info about my dads condition and recovery.The food was very good. And the fact that patients get so much choice, for example about when they want to eat etc, was also good.

I did appreciate the fact that the doors to the wards were locked. This is good and important. The receptionist on the 4th floor who had to let me in a few times was extremely nice and helpful. Blonde possibly polish? Really lovely lady.",[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.]

The staff is incredible, the doctor, the anaesthetist and all the nursing staff. Truly 10/10 and I express my gratitude to all of them.

However, as for the clinic, two very disappointing things:

1. My procedure was almost 3h delayed due to lack of anaesthetists 
2. I have coeliac disease and this was very clearly stated in my file, yet the clinic has no gluten free option on the menu. The nurse, very kindly, called the kitchen and they said they had some gluten free bread, that didn’t give me much confidence in terms of them having the clear understanding of cross contamination risk.

14170,"Very polite, kind S&L therpaist who was excellent at demonstrating the therapy/games. But many improvements and resoures required to deliver therapy overall could be made:

1. Ideally before the first session or at first session need to inform parent approximately how much time is needed for therapy per day so parents can start thinking about when they will fit this into their day. In my sons case (with probable ASD) it is not just 5 minutes of special time but around 20 minutes per day in total. My husband and I have had to make time for therapy on weekdays when my son does not attend nursery and weekends. We have 2 other children. If there is more than one child at home need to inform parent that the other children will need to be kept busy in order for the therapy. No TV on, no toys around the room. No time for therapy/distractions means therapy will not work!

2. Writing my own notes in sessions means that I deliver better therapy. This definitely worked for my other son who had therapy in 2019. Parents should be given the option/encouraged to write their own notes to help them deliver therapy correctly at home.

3. Some of the games are very dated (2004!) - in black and white, pictures not clear, very unappealing for a three year old. I think this is a huge area of improvement. Therapy using dated games did not/are not working for my son at home. Nursery also commented the same that the sheets are so old and my son is not interested in them at all. Therapy using vibrant clear pictures was/is much more successful with my son.

4. Online videos of popular therapies to be made available to parents to refer to regaulrly to ensure parents are doing therapy correctly. Even if 1 or 2 can be made this is a starting point and provides motivation and reassurance for parents.

5. More sessions are required for children. I am really worried that the number of sessions he has received is not enough and he will struggle with S&L when he starts school next year.",[0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

The pharmacy took hours to deliver the meds on check out, the shampoo dispenser in the shower was broken and I left the room with it still broken.

The Cleveland Clinic has outstanding facilities and world class consultants - it is important that the systems that support this are also maintained to world class standard. Less there be a misunderstanding - individually, the people selected are each gems and I could only wish to someday die in the hands of people such as you have working at Cleveland Clinic.

14687,"When I was at a place that felt like rock bottom I was assigned Emily Pearson-Moase as my primary care mental health nurse. I'd suffered on and off mentally through the years but thought that was just who I was. After a recent episode of destructive and reckless behaviour I found myself in Emily's care. Emily always took my thoughts and feeling seriously, she provided me with a safe space to offload feeling and thoughts I had been battling with. Emily was always there to discuss medication side effects and made me feel heard and respected in terms of adverse side effects.

14880,"Yes several issues which require improvement and may detract from a Patient's experience -

1)I am 81 yrs old and on arrival in an Uber and with walking stick and bag at an Uber Dropoff entrance and in spite of confirming that I was a Patient seeking admission (for hip replacement) I was refused entry by Security and told to walk outside down the pavement to find the Main Entrance. No assistance with bag and poor directions given to locate main entrance. This was unforgivable !! 
Obviously I should have been directed / accompanied with minor assistance through the hospital past the Restaurant to Reception.
Talking with a member of staff on another occasion I learned that my experience was actually not uncommon, this issue had been flagged up before, but nothing had been done about it - Security were just plain lazy.

2)My payment for treatment was made the day before treatment.When I make an online transfer the result is shown in my account(s) within minutes of action taken.....BUT it takes two days to show in Cleveland's Accounts which in this situation results in the initial checkin being akin to a third degree for the patient to prove that the payment has actually been made ! This requires sorting with your Bankers / Accounts pdq.....it is surely not rocket science..... and the Cleveland has been open for over 3 months now.

3)The MyChart software is incapable of taking a part payment of required treatment total by Credit Card.

4)I was 'Self Pay' on a 'Package' - there is an issue with departments providing treatment in that some appear unaware of the components within a Patient's Package and seek to charge for treatment items which are actually included within the Patient's Package. Obviously this is a recipe for confusion and Patient dissatisfaction !",[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

14959,Your gateway screening staff were really poor. The first person I spoke to at Gateway screening was [name removed]. He dismissed my depression stating for example that not bathing for 5 days if I had nowhere to go was normal and not a sign of depression. For me this was a clear example of executive dysfunction and depression. He was incredibly slow to understand what I was saying and took a long time to write a note. I felt as if he didn't know what he was doing. He didn't seem to know the correct referral protocol either. I mentioned I'd been seen by a psychiatrist before and they had discharged me after a while and he said he couldn't continue unless he saw that letter. This was such a waste of time having to resxhedule. This seemed odd given I am presenting with symptoms and a letter shouldn't be a bar to recieving care. It was an uncomfortable conversation and I felt he was incompetent to do his role. It's not acceptable to have someone with his lack of understanding of mental health to be the first person you speak to. Whenever he asked a question around my mental health he didn't seem to accept it so I found myself having to justify myself even further. I was ready to give up. I hope this feedback will be given to him and his appraiser as I don't think he is suitable for that role.
